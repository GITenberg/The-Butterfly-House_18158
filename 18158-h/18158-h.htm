<h4 align="center">Chapter I</h4>

<p>Fairbridge, the little New Jersey village, or rather city (for it
had won municipal government some years before, in spite of the
protest of far-seeing citizens who descried in the distance bonded
debts out of proportion to the tiny shoulders of the place), was a
misnomer. Often a person, being in Fairbridge for the first time, and
being driven by way of entertainment about the rural streets, would
inquire, &ldquo;Why Fairbridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bridges there were none, except those over which the trains
thundered to and from New York, and the adjective, except to old
inhabitants who had a curious fierce loyalty for the place, did not
seemingly apply. Fairbridge could hardly, by an unbiassed person who
did not dwell in the little village and view its features through the
rosy glamour of home life, be called &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;  There were
a few pretty streets, with well-kept sidewalks, and ambitious,
although small houses, and there were many lovely bits of views to be
obtained, especially in the green flush of spring, and the red glow
of autumn over the softly swelling New Jersey landscape with its warm
red soil to the distant rise of low blue hills; but it was not fair
enough in a general way to justify its name. Yet Fairbridge it was,
without bridge, or natural beauty, and no mortal knew why. The origin
of the name was lost in the petty mist of a petty past.</p>

<p>Fairbridge was tragically petty, inasmuch as it saw itself great.
In Fairbridge narrowness reigned, nay, tyrannised, and was not
recognised as such. There was something fairly uncanny about
Fairbridge's influence upon people after they had lived there even a
few years. The influence held good, too, in the cases of men who
daily went to business or professions in New York. Even Wall Street
was no sinecure. Back they would come at night, and the terrible,
narrow maelstrom of pettiness sucked them in. All outside interest
was as naught. International affairs seemed insignificant when once
one was really in Fairbridge.</p>

<p>Fairbridge, although rampant when local politics were concerned,
had no regard whatever for those of the nation at large, except as
they involved Fairbridge. Fairbridge, to its own understanding, was a
nucleus, an ultimatum. It was an example of the triumph of the
infinitesimal. It saw itself through a microscope and loomed up
gigantic. Fairbridge was like an insect, born with the conviction
that it was an elephant. There was at once something ludicrous, and
magnificent, and terrible about it. It had the impressiveness of the
abnormal and prehistoric. In one sense, it <em>was</em> prehistoric.
It was as a giant survivor of a degenerate species.</p>

<p>Withal, it was puzzling. People if pinned down could not say why,
in Fairbridge, the little was so monstrous, whether it depended upon
local conditions, upon the general population, or upon a few who had
an undue estimation of themselves and all connected with them. Was
Fairbridge great because of its inhabitants, or were the inhabitants
great because of Fairbridge? Who could say? And why was Fairbridge so
important that its very smallness overwhelmed that which, by the
nature of things, seemed overwhelming? Nobody knew, or rather, so
tremendous was the power of the small in the village, that nobody
inquired.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that had there been any delicate gauge of
mentality, the actual swelling of the individual in his own
estimation as he neared Fairbridge after a few hours' absence, might
have been apparent. Take a broker on Wall Street, for instance, or a
lawyer who had threaded his painful way to the dim light of
understanding through the intricate mazes of the law all day, as his
train neared his loved village. From an atom that went to make up the
motive power of a great metropolis, he himself became an entirety. He
was It with a capital letter. No wonder that under the circumstances
Fairbridge had charms that allured, that people chose it for suburban
residences, that the small, ornate, new houses with their perky
little towers and &aelig;sthetic diamond-paned windows,
multiplied.</p>

<p>Fairbridge was in reality very artistically planned as to the
sites of its houses. Instead of the regulation Main Street of the
country village, with its centre given up to shops and post-office,
side streets wound here and there, and houses were placed with a view
to effect.</p>

<p>The Main Street of Fairbridge was as naught from a social point of
view. Nobody of any social importance lived there. Even the
physicians had their residences and offices in a more aristocratic
locality. Upon the Main Street proper, that which formed the centre
of the village, there were only shops and a schoolhouse and one or
two mean public buildings. For a village of the self-importance of
Fairbridge, the public buildings were very few and very mean. There
was no city hall worthy of the name of this little city which held
its head so high. The City Hall, so designated by ornate gilt letters
upon the glass panel of a very small door, occupied part of the
building in which was the post-office. It was a tiny building, two
stories high. On the second floor was the millinery shop of Mrs.
Creevy, and behind it the two rooms in which she kept house with her
daughter Jessy.</p>

<p>On the lower floor was the post-office on the right, filthy with
the foot tracks of the Fairbridge children who crowded it in a noisy
rabble twice a day, and perpetually red-stained with the shale of New
Jersey, brought in upon the boots of New Jersey farmers, who always
bore about with them a goodly portion of their native soil. On the
left, was the City Hall. This was vacant except upon the first Monday
of every month, when the janitor of the Dutch Reformed Church, who
eked out a scanty salary with divers other tasks, got himself to
work, and slopped pails of water over the floor, then swept, and
built a fire, if in winter.</p>

<p>Upon the evenings of these first Mondays the Mayor and city
officials met and made great talk over small matters, and with the
labouring of a mountain, brought forth mice. The City Hall was closed
upon other occasions, unless the village talent gave a play for some
local benefit. Fairbridge was intensely dramatic, and it was
popularly considered that great, natural, histrionic gifts were
squandered upon the Fairbridge audiences, appreciative though they
were. Outside talent was never in evidence in Fairbridge. No
theatrical company had ever essayed to rent that City Hall. People in
Fairbridge put that somewhat humiliating fact from their minds.
Nothing would have induced a loyal citizen to admit that Fairbridge
was too small game for such purposes. There was a tiny theatre in the
neighbouring city of Axminister, which had really some claims to
being called a city, from tradition and usage, aside from size.
Axminister was an ancient Dutch city, horribly uncomfortable, but
exceedingly picturesque. Fairbridge looked down upon it, and seldom
patronised the shows (they never said &ldquo;plays&rdquo;) staged in
its miniature theatre. When they did not resort to their own City
Hall for entertainment by local talent, they arrayed themselves in
their best and patronised New York itself.</p>

<p>New York did not know that it was patronised, but Fairbridge knew.
When Mr. and Mrs. George B. Slade boarded the seven o'clock train,
Mrs. Slade, tall, and majestically handsome, arrayed most elegantly,
and crowned with a white hat (Mrs. Slade always affected white hats
with long drooping plumes upon such occasions), and George B., natty
in his light top coat, standing well back upon the heels of his shiny
shoes, with the air of the wealthy and well-assured, holding a belted
cigar in the tips of his grey-gloved fingers, New York was most
distinctly patronised, although without knowing it.</p>

<p>It was also patronised, and to a greater extent, by little Mrs.
Wilbur Edes, very little indeed, so little as to be almost symbolic
of Fairbridge itself, but elegant in every detail, so elegant as to
arrest the eye of everybody as she entered the train, holding up the
tail of her black lace gown. Mrs. Edes doted on black lace. Her
small, fair face peered with a curious calm alertness from under the
black plumes of her great picture hat, perched sidewise upon a
carefully waved pale gold pompadour, which was perfection and would
have done credit to the best hairdresser or the best French maid in
New York, but which was achieved solely by Mrs. Wilbur Edes' own
native wit and skilful fingers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilbur Edes, although small, was masterly in everything, from
waving a pompadour to conducting theatricals. She herself was the
star dramatic performer of Fairbridge. There was a strong feeling in
Fairbridge that in reality she might, if she chose, rival Bernhardt.
Mrs. Emerston Strong, who had been abroad and had seen Bernhardt on
her native soil, had often said that Mrs. Edes reminded her of the
great French actress, although she was much handsomer, and so moral!
Mrs. Wilbur Edes was masterly in morals, as in everything else. She
was much admired by the opposite sex, but she was a model wife and
mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilbur Edes was an admired accessory of his wife. He was so
very tall and slender as to suggest forcible elongation. He carried
his head with a deprecatory, sidewise air as if in accordance with
his wife's picture hat, and yet Mr. Wilbur Edes, out of Fairbridge
and in his law office on Broadway, was a man among men. He was an
exception to the personal esteem which usually expanded a male
citizen of Fairbridge, but he was the one and only husband of Mrs.
Wilbur Edes, and there was not room at such an apex as she occupied
for more than one. Tall as Wilbur Edes was, he was overshadowed by
that immaculate blond pompadour and that plumed picture hat. He was a
prime favourite in Fairbridge society; he was liked and admired, but
his radiance was reflected, and he was satisfied that it should be
so. He adored his wife. The shadow of her black picture hat was his
place of perfect content. He watched the admiring glances of other
men at his wonderful possession with a triumph and pride which made
him really rather a noble sort. He was also so fond and proud of his
little twin daughters, Maida and Adelaide, that the fondness and
pride fairly illuminated his inner self. Wilbur Edes was a clever
lawyer, but love made him something bigger. It caused him to immolate
self, which is spiritually enlarging self.</p>

<p>In one respect Wilbur Edes was the biggest man in Fairbridge; in
another, Doctor Sturtevant was. Doctor Sturtevant depended upon no
other person for his glory. He shone as a fixed star, with his own
lustre. He was esteemed a very great physician indeed, and it was
considered that Mrs. Sturtevant, who was good, and honest, and portly
with a tight, middle-aged portliness, hardly lived up to her husband.
It was admitted that she tried, poor soul, but her limitations were
held to be impossible, even by her faithful straining following of
love.</p>

<p>When the splendid, florid Doctor, with his majestically curving
expanse of waistcoat and his inscrutable face, whirred through the
streets of Fairbridge in his motor car, with that meek bulk of
womanhood beside him, many said quite openly how unfortunate it was
that Doctor Sturtevant had married, when so young, a woman so
manifestly his inferior. They never failed to confer that faint
praise, which is worse than none at all, upon the poor soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a good woman,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;She means
well, and she is a good housekeeper, but she is no companion for a
man like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Sturtevant was aware of her status in Fairbridge, and
she was not without a steady, plodding ambition of her own. That
utterly commonplace, middle-aged face had some lines of strength.
Mrs. Sturtevant was a member of the women's club of Fairbridge, which
was poetically and cleverly called the Zenith Club.</p>

<p>She wrote, whenever it was her turn to do so, papers upon every
imaginable subject. She balked at nothing whatever. She ranged from
household discussions to the Orient. Then she stood up in the midst
of the women, sunk her double chin in her lace collar, and read her
paper in a voice like the whisper of a blade of grass. Doctor
Sturtevant had a very low voice. His wife had naturally a strident
one, but she essayed to follow him in the matter of voice, as in all
other things. The poor hen bird tried to voice her thoughts like her
mate, and the result was a strange and weird note. However, Mrs.
Sturtevant herself was not aware of the result. When she sat down
after finishing her papers her face was always becomingly flushed
with pleasure.</p>

<p>Nothing, not even pleasure, was becoming to Mrs. Sturtevant. Life
itself was unbecoming to her, and the worst of it was nobody knew it,
and everybody said it was due to Mrs. Sturtevant's lack of taste, and
then they pitied the great doctor anew. It was very fortunate that it
never occurred to Mrs. Sturtevant to pity the doctor on her account,
for she was so fond of him, poor soul, that it might have led to a
tragedy.</p>

<p>The Zenith Club of Fairbridge always met on Friday afternoons. It
was a cherished aim of the Club to uproot foolish superstitions,
hence Friday. It did not seem in the least risky to the ordinary
person for a woman to attend a meeting of the Zenith Club on a
Friday, in preference to any other day in the week; but many a member
had a covert feeling that she was somewhat heroic, especially if the
meeting was held at the home of some distant member on an icy day in
winter, and she was obliged to make use of a livery carriage.</p>

<p>There were in Fairbridge three keepers of livery stables, and
curiously enough, no rivalry between them. All three were natives of
the soil, and somewhat sluggish in nature, like its sticky red shale.
They did not move with much enthusiasm, neither were they to be
easily removed. When the New York trains came in, they, with their
equally indifferent drivers, sat comfortably ensconced in their
carriages, and never waylaid the possible passengers alighting from
the train. Sometimes they did not even open the carriage doors, but
they, however, saw to it that they were closed when once the
passenger was within, and that was something. All three drove
indifferent horses, somewhat uncertain as to footing. When a woman
sat behind these weak-kneed, badly shod steeds and realised that
Stumps, or Fitzgerald, or Witless was driving with an utter
indifference to the tightening of lines at dangerous places, and also
realised that it was Friday, some strength of character was doubtless
required.</p>

<p>One Friday in January, two young women, one married, one single,
one very pretty, and both well-dressed (most of the women who
belonged to the Fairbridge social set dressed well) were being driven
by Jim Fitzgerald a distance of a mile or more, up a long hill. The
slope was gentle and languid, like nearly every slope in that part of
the state, but that day it was menacing with ice. It was one smooth
glaze over the macadam. Jim Fitzgerald, a descendant of a fine old
family whose type had degenerated, sat hunched upon the driver's
seat, his loose jaw hanging, his eyes absent, his mouth open, chewing
with slow enjoyment his beloved quid, while the reins lay slackly on
the rusty black robe tucked over his knees. Even a corner of that
dragged dangerously near the right wheels of the coup&eacute;. Jim
had not sufficient energy to tuck it in firmly, although the wind was
sharp from the northwest.</p>

<p>Alice Mendon paid no attention to it, but her companion, Daisy
Shaw, otherwise Mrs. Sumner Shaw, who was of the tense, nervous type,
had remarked it uneasily when they first started. She had rapped
vigorously upon the front window, and a misty, rather beautiful blue
eye had rolled interrogatively over Jim's shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your robe is dragging,&rdquo; shrieked in shrill staccato
Daisy Shaw; and there had been a dull nod of the head, a feeble pull
at the dragging robe, then it had dragged again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't mind, dear,&rdquo; said Alice Mendon. &ldquo;It
is his own lookout if he loses the robe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't that,&rdquo; responded Daisy querulously.
&ldquo;It isn't that. I don't care, since he is so careless, if he
does lose it, but I must say that I don't think it is safe. Suppose
it got caught in the wheel, and I know this horse
stumbles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't worry, dear,&rdquo; said Alice Mendon.
&ldquo;Fitzgerald's robe always drags, and nothing ever
happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice Mendon was a young woman, not a young girl (she had left
young girlhood behind several years since) and she was distinctly
beautiful after a fashion that is not easily affected by the passing
years. She had had rather an eventful life, but not an event,
pleasant or otherwise, had left its mark upon the smooth oval of her
face. There was not a side nor retrospective glance to disturb the
serenity of her large blue eyes. Although her eyes were blue, her
hair was almost chestnut black, except in certain lights, when it
gave out gleams as of dark gold. Her features were full, her figure
large, but not too large. She wore a dark red tailored gown; and
sumptuous sable furs shaded with dusky softness and shot, in the sun,
with prismatic gleams, set off her handsome, not exactly smiling, but
serenely beaming face. Two great black ostrich plumes and one red one
curled down toward the soft spikes of the fur. Between, the two great
blue eyes, the soft oval of the cheeks, and the pleasant red fullness
of the lips appeared.</p>

<p>Poor Daisy Shaw, who was poor in two senses, strength of nerve and
money, looked blue and cold in her little black suit, and her pale
blue liberty scarf was horribly inadequate and unbecoming. Daisy was
really painful to see as she gazed out apprehensively at the dragging
robe, and the glistening slant over which they were moving. Alice
regarded her not so much with pity as with a calm, sheltering sense
of superiority and strength. She pulled the inner robe of the
coup&eacute; up and tucked it firmly around Daisy's thin knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look half frozen,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't mind being frozen, but I do mind being
scared,&rdquo; replied Daisy sharply. She removed the robe with a
twitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that old horse stumbles and goes down and kicks, I want
to be able to get out without being all tangled up in a robe and
dragged,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the horse is kicking and down I don't see how he can
drag you very far,&rdquo; said Alice with a slight laugh. Then the
horse stumbled. Daisy Shaw knocked quickly on the front window with
her little, nervous hand in its tight, white kid glove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do please hold your reins tighter,&rdquo; she called. Again
the misty blue eyes rolled about, the head nodded, the rotary jaws
were seen, the robe dragged, the reins lay loosely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn't a stumble worth mentioning,&rdquo; said Alice
Mendon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he would stop chewing and drive,&rdquo; said poor
Daisy Shaw vehemently. &ldquo;I wish we had a liveryman as good as
that Dougherty in Axminister. I was making calls there the other day,
and it was as slippery as it is now, and he held the reins up tight
every minute. I felt safe with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think anything will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem to me if he doesn't stop chewing, and drive, I
shall fly!&rdquo; said Daisy.</p>

<p>Alice regarded her with a little wonder. Such anxiety concerning
personal safety rather puzzled her. &ldquo;My horses ran away the
other day, and Dick went down flat and barked his knees; that's why I
have Fitzgerald to-day,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I was not hurt.
Nobody was hurt except the horse. I was very sorry about the
horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had an automobile,&rdquo; said Daisy. &ldquo;You
never know what a horse will do next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed again slightly. &ldquo;There is a little doubt
sometimes as to what an automobile will do next,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is your own brain that controls it, if you can run
it yourself, as you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure. Sometimes I wonder if the automobile
hasn't an uncanny sort of brain itself. Sometimes I wonder how far
men can go with the invention of machinery without putting more of
themselves into it than they bargain for,&rdquo; said Alice. Her
smooth face did not contract in the least, but was brooding with
speculation and thought.</p>

<p>Then the horse stumbled again, and Daisy screamed, and again
tapped the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won't go way down,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;I think he
is too stiff. Don't worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no stumbling to worry about with an
automobile,&rdquo; said Daisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn't use one on this hill without more risk than
you take with a stumbling horse,&rdquo; replied Alice. Just then a
carriage drawn by two fine bays passed them, and there was an
interchange of nods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is Mrs. Sturtevant,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;She
isn't using the automobile to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Sturtevant has had that coachman thirty years, and
he doesn't chew, he drives,&rdquo; said Daisy.</p>

<p>Then they drew up before the house which was their destination,
Mrs. George B. Slade's. The house was very small, but perkily
pretentious, and they drove under the porte-coch&egrave;re to
alight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard Mr. Slade had been making a great deal of money in
cotton lately,&rdquo; Daisy whispered, as the carriage stopped behind
Mrs. Sturtevant's. &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Slade went to the opera last
week. I heard they had taken a box for the season, and Mrs. Slade had
a new black velvet gown and a pearl necklace. I think she is almost
too old to wear low neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not so very old,&rdquo; replied Alice. &ldquo;It is
only her white hair that makes her seem so.&rdquo;  Then she extended
a rather large but well gloved hand and opened the coup&eacute; door,
while Jim Fitzgerald sat and chewed and waited, and the two young
women got out. Daisy had some trouble in holding up her long skirts.
She tugged at them with nervous energy, and told Alice of the
twenty-five cents which Fitzgerald would ask for the return trip. She
had wished to arrive at the club in fine feather, but had counted on
walking home in the dusk, with her best skirts high-kilted, and
saving an honest penny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense; of course you will go with me,&rdquo; said Alice
in the calmly imperious way she had, and the two mounted the steps.
They had scarcely reached the door before Mrs. Slade's maid, Lottie,
appeared in her immaculate width of apron, with carefully-pulled-out
bows and little white lace top-knot. &ldquo;Upstairs, front
room,&rdquo; she murmured, and the two went up the polished stairs.
There was a landing halfway, with a diamond paned window and one
rubber plant and two palms, all very glossy, and all three in nice
green jardini&egrave;res which exactly matched the paper on the walls
of the hall. Mrs. George B. Slade had a mania for exactly matching
things. Some of her friends said among themselves that she carried it
almost too far.</p>

<p>The front room, the guest room, into which Alice Mendon and Daisy
Shaw passed, was done in yellow and white, and one felt almost sinful
in disturbing the harmony by any other tint. The walls were yellow,
with a frieze of garlands of yellow roses; the ceiling was tinted
yellow, the tiles on the shining little hearth were yellow, every
ornament upon the mantel-shelf was yellow, down to a china
shepherdess who wore a yellow china gown and carried a basket filled
with yellow flowers, and bore a yellow crook. The bedstead was brass,
and there was a counterpane of white lace over yellow, the muslin
curtains were tied back with great bows of yellow ribbon. Even the
pictures represented yellow flowers or maidens dressed in yellow. The
rugs were yellow, the furniture upholstered in yellow, and all of
exactly the same shade.</p>

<p>There were a number of ladies in this yellow room, prinking
themselves before going downstairs. They all lived in Fairbridge;
they all knew each other; but they greeted one another with the most
elegant formality. Alice assisted Daisy Shaw to remove her coat and
liberty scarf, then she shook herself free of her own wraps, rather
than removed them. She did not even glance at herself in the glass.
Her reason for so doing was partly confidence in her own appearance,
partly distrust of the glass. She had viewed herself carefully in her
own looking-glass before she left home. She believed in what she had
seen there, but she did not care to disturb that belief, and she saw
that Mrs. Slade's mirror over her white and yellow draped dressing
table stood in a cross-light. While all admitted Alice Mendon's
beauty, nobody had ever suspected her of vanity; yet vanity she had,
in a degree.</p>

<p>The other women in the room looked at her. It was always a matter
of interest of Fairbridge what she would wear, and this was rather
curious, as, after all, she had not many gowns. There was a certain
impressiveness about her mode of wearing the same gown which seemed
to create an illusion. To-day in her dark red gown embroidered with
poppies of still another shade, she created a distinctly new
impression, although she had worn the same costume often before at
the club meetings. She went downstairs in advance of the other women
who had arrived before, and were yet anxiously peering at themselves
in the cross-lighted mirror, and being adjusted as to refractory
neckwear by one another.</p>

<p>When Alice entered Mrs. Slade's elegant little reception-room,
which was done in a dull rose colour, its accessories very exactly
matching, even to Mrs. Slade's own costume, which was rose silk under
black lace, she was led at once to a lady richly attired in black,
with gleams of jet, who was seated in a large chair in the place of
honour, not quite in the bay window but exactly in the centre of the
opening. The lady quite filled the chair. She was very stout. Her
face, under an ornate black hat, was like a great rose full of
overlapping curves of florid flesh. The wide mouth was perpetually
curved into a bow of mirth, the small black eyes twinkled. She was
Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder, who had come from New York to deliver her
famous lecture upon the subject: &ldquo;Where does a woman shine with
more lustre, at home or abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The programme was to be varied, as usual upon such occasions, by
local talent. Leila MacDonald, who sang contralto in the church
choir, and Mrs. Arthur Wells, who sang soprano, and Mrs. Jack Evarts,
who played the piano very well, and Miss Sally Anderson, who had
taken lessons in elocution, all had their parts, besides the
president of the club, Mrs. Wilbur Edes, who had a brief address in
readiness, and the secretary, who had to give the club report for the
year. Mrs. Snyder was to give her lecture as a grand climax, then
there were to be light refreshments and a reception following the
usual custom of the club.</p>

<p>Alice bowed before Mrs. Snyder and retreated to a window at the
other side of the room. She sat beside the window and looked out.
Just then one of the other liverymen drove up with a carriage full of
ladies, and they emerged in a flutter of veils and silk skirts. Mrs.
Slade, who was really superb in her rose silk and black lace, with an
artful frill of white lace at her throat to match her great puff of
white hair, remained beside Mrs. Snyder, whose bow of mirth
widened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that magnificent creature?&rdquo; whispered Mrs.
Snyder with a gush of enthusiasm, indicating Alice beside the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She lives here,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Slade rather stupidly.
She did not quite know how to define Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lives here in this little place? Not all the year?&rdquo;
rejoined Mrs. Snyder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairbridge is a very good place to live in all the
year,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Slade rather stiffly. &ldquo;It is near New
York. We have all the advantages of a great metropolis without the
drawbacks. Fairbridge is a most charming city, and very progressive,
yes, very progressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Slade took it rather hardly that Mrs. Snyder should intimate
anything prejudicial to Fairbridge and especially that it was not
good enough for Alice Mendon, who had been born there, and lived
there all her life except the year she had been in college. If
anything, she, Mrs. Slade, wondered if Alice Mendon were good enough
for Fairbridge. What had she ever done, except to wear handsome
costumes and look handsome and self-possessed? Although she belonged
to the Zenith Club, no power on earth could induce her to discharge
the duties connected herewith, except to pay her part of the
expenses, and open her house for a meeting. She simply would not
write a paper upon any interesting and instructive topic and read it
before the club, and she was not considered gifted. She could not
sing like Leila MacDonald and Mrs. Arthur Wells. She could not play
like Mrs. Jack Evarts. She could not recite like Sally Anderson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Snyder glanced across at Alice, who looked very graceful and
handsome, although also, to a discerning eye, a little sulky, and
bored with a curious, abstracted boredom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is superb,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Snyder, &ldquo;yes,
simply superb. Why does she live here, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she was born here,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Slade, again
stupidly. It was as if Alice had no more motive power than a
flowering bush.</p>

<p>Mrs. Snyder's bow of mirth widened into a laugh. &ldquo;Well,
can't she get away, even if she was born here?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>However, Mrs. George B. Slade's mind travelled in such a circle
that she was difficult to corner. &ldquo;Why should she want to
move?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Mrs. Snyder laughed again. &ldquo;But, granting she should want to
move, is there anything to hinder?&rdquo; she asked. She wasn't a
very clever woman, and was deciding privately to mimic Mrs. George B.
Slade at some future occasion, and so eke out her scanty
remuneration. She did not think ten dollars and expenses quite enough
for such a lecture as hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Slade looked at her perplexedly. &ldquo;Why, yes, she could I
suppose,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has hindered her before now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, her mother was a helpless invalid, and Alice was the
only child, and she had been in college just a year when her father
died, then she came home and lived with her mother, but her mother
has been dead two years now, and Alice has plenty of money. Her
father left a good deal, and her cousin and aunt live with her. Oh,
yes, she could, but why should she want to leave Fairbridge,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then some new arrivals approached, and the discussion concerning
Alice Mendon ceased. The ladies came rapidly now. Soon Mrs. Slade's
hall, reception-room, and dining-room, in which a gaily-decked table
was set, were thronged with women whose very skirts seemed full of
important anticipatory stirs and rustles. Mrs. Snyder's curved smile
became set, her eyes absent. She was revolving her lecture in her
mind, making sure that she could repeat it without the assistance of
the notes in her petticoat pocket.</p>

<p>Then a woman rang a little silver bell, and a woman who sat short
but rose to unexpected heights stood up. The phenomenon was amazing,
but all the Fairbridge ladies had seen Miss Bessy Dicky, the
secretary of the Zenith Club, rise before, and no one observed
anything remarkable about it. Only Mrs. Snyder's mouth twitched a
little, but she instantly recovered herself and fixed her absent eyes
upon Miss Bessy Dicky's long, pale face as she began to read the
report of the club for the past year.</p>

<p>She had been reading several minutes, her glasses fixed firmly
(one of her eyes had a cast) and her lean, veinous hands trembling
with excitement, when the door bell rang with a sharp peremptory
peal. There was a little flutter among the ladies. Such a thing had
never happened before. Fairbridge ladies were renowned for
punctuality, especially at a meeting like this, and in any case, had
one been late, she would never have rung the bell. She would have
tapped gently on the door, the white-capped maid would have admitted
her, and she, knowing she was late and hearing the hollow recitative
of Miss Bessy Dicky's voice, would have tiptoed upstairs, then
slipped delicately down again and into a place near the door.</p>

<p>But now it was different. Lottie opened the door, and a masculine
voice was heard. Mrs. Slade had a storm-porch, so no one could look
directly into the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Slade at home?&rdquo; inquired the voice
distinctly. The ladies looked at one another, and Miss Bessy Dicky's
reading was unheard. They all knew who spoke. Lottie appeared with a
crimson face, bearing a little ostentatious silver plate with a card.
Mrs. Slade adjusted her lorgnette, looked at the card, and appeared
to hesitate for a second. Then a look of calm determination
overspread her face. She whispered to Lottie, and presently appeared
a young man in clerical costume, moving between the seated groups of
ladies with an air not so much of embarrassment as of weary patience,
as if he had expected something like this to happen, and it had
happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Slade motioned to a chair near her, which Lottie had placed,
and the young man sat down.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter II</h4>

<p>Many things were puzzling in Fairbridge, that is, puzzling to a
person with a logical turn of mind. For instance, nobody could say
that Fairbridge people were not religious. It was a church going
community, and five denominations were represented in it;
nevertheless, the professional expounders of its doctrines were held
in a sort of gentle derision, that is, unless the expounder happened
to be young and eligible from a matrimonial point of view, when he
gained a certain fleeting distinction. Otherwise the clergy were
regarded (in very much the same light as if employed by a railroad)
as the conductors of a spiritual train of cars bound for the Promised
Land. They were admittedly engaged in a cause worthy of the highest
respect and veneration. The Cause commanded it, not they. They had
always lacked social prestige in Fairbridge, except, as before
stated, in the cases of the matrimonially eligible.</p>

<p>Dominie von Rosen came under that head. Consequently he was for
the moment, fleeting as everybody considered it, in request. But he
did not respond readily to the social patronage of Fairbridge. He
was, seemingly, quite oblivious to its importance. Karl von Rosen was
bored to the verge of physical illness by Fairbridge functions. Even
a church affair found him wearily to the front. Therefore his
presence at the Zenith Club was unprecedented and confounding. He had
often been asked to attend its special meetings but had never
accepted. Now, however, here he was, caught neatly in the trap of his
own carelessness. Karl von Rosen should have reflected that the
Zenith Club was one of the institutions of Fairbridge, and met upon a
Friday, and that Mrs. George B. Slade's house was an exceedingly
likely rendezvous, but he was singularly absent-minded as to what was
near, and very present minded as to what was afar. That which should
have been near was generally far to his mind, which was perpetually
gathering the wool of rainbow sheep in distant pastures.</p>

<p>If there was anything in which Karl von Rosen did not take the
slightest interest, it was women's clubs in general and the Zenith
Club in particular; and here he was, doomed by his own lack of
thought to sit through an especially long session. He had gone out
for a walk. To his mind it was a fine winter's day. The long,
glittering lights of ice pleased him and whenever he was sure that he
was unobserved he took a boyish run and long slide. During his walk
he had reached Mrs. Slade's house, and since he worked in his
pastoral calls whenever he could, by applying a sharp spur to his
disinclination, it had occurred to him that he might make one, and
return to his study in a virtuous frame of mind over a slight and
unimportant, but bothersome duty performed. If he had had his wits
about him he might have seen the feminine heads at the windows, he
might have heard the quaver of Miss Bessy Dicky's voice over the club
report; but he saw and heard nothing, and now he was seated in the
midst of the feminine throng, and Miss Bessy Dicky's voice quavered
more, and she assumed a slightly mincing attitude. Her thin hands
trembled more, the hot, red spots on her thin cheeks deepened.
Reading the club reports before the minister was an epoch in an
epochless life, but Karl von Rosen was oblivious of her except as a
disturbing element rather more insistent than the others in which he
was submerged.</p>

<img src="images/bh1.jpg" width="1100" height="723"
alt="[Illustration: He was doomed by his own lack of thought to sit
through an especially long session]">

<p>He sat straight and grave, his eyes retrospective. He was
constantly getting into awkward situations, and acquitting himself in
them with marvellous dignity and grace. Even Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder,
astute as she was, regarded him keenly, and could not for the life of
her tell whether he had come premeditatedly or not. She only
discovered one thing, that poor Miss Bessy Dicky was reading at him
and posing at him and trembling her hands at him, and that she was
throwing it all away, for Von Rosen heard no more of her report than
if he had been in China when she was reading it. Mrs. Snyder realised
that hardly anything in nature could be so totally uninteresting to
the young man as the report of a woman's club. Inasmuch as she
herself was devoted to such things, she regarded him with
disapproval, although with a certain admiration. Karl von Rosen
always commanded admiration, although often of a grudging character,
from women. His utter indifference to them as women was the prime
factor in this; next to that his really attractive, even
distinguished, personality. He was handsome after the fashion which
usually accompanies devotion to women. He was slight, but sinewy,
with a gentle, poetical face and great black eyes, into which women
were apt to project tenderness merely from their own fancy. It seemed
ridiculous and anomalous that a man of Von Rosen's type should not be
a lover of ladies, and the fact that he was most certainly not was
both fascinating and exasperating.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. George B. Slade, magnificent matron, as she was, moreover
one who had inhaled the perfume of adulation from her youth up, felt
a calm malice. She knew that he had entered her parlour after the
manner of the spider and fly rhyme of her childhood; she knew that
the other ladies would infer that he had come upon her invitation,
and her soul was filled with one of the petty triumphs of petty
Fairbridge.</p>

<p>She, however, did not dream of the actual misery which filled the
heart of the graceful, dignified young man by her side. She
considered herself in the position of a mother, who forces an
undesired, but nevertheless, delectable sweet upon a child, who gazes
at her with adoration when the savour has reached his palate. She did
not expect Von Rosen to be much edified by Miss Bessy Dicky's report.
She had her own opinion of Miss Bessy Dicky, of her sleeves, of her
gown, and her report, but she had faith in the truly decorative
features of the occasion when they should be underway, and she had
immense faith in Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder. She was relieved when Miss
Bessy Dicky sat down, and endeavoured to compose her knees, which by
this time were trembling like her hands, and also to assume an
expression as if she had done nothing at all, and nobody was looking
at her. That last because of the fact that she had done so little,
and nobody was looking at her rendered her rather pathetic.</p>

<p>Miss Bessy Dicky did not glance at the minister, but she,
nevertheless, saw him. She had never had a lover, and here was the
hero of her dreams. He would never know it and nobody else would ever
know it, and no harm would be done except very possibly, by and by, a
laceration of the emotions of an elderly maiden, and afterwards a
life-long scar. But who goes through life without emotional
scars?</p>

<p>After Miss Bessy Dicky sat down, Mrs. Wilbur Edes, the lady of the
silver bell, rose. She lifted high her delicate chin, her perfect
blond pompadour caught the light, her black lace robe swept round her
in rich darkness, with occasional revelations of flower and leaf, the
fairly poetical pattern of real lace. As she rose, she diffused
around her a perfume as if rose-leaves were stirred up. She held a
dainty handkerchief, edged with real lace, in her little left hand,
which glittered with rings. In her right, was a spangled fan like a
black butterfly. Mrs. Edes was past her first youth, but she was
undeniably charming. She was like a little, perfect, ivory toy, which
time has played with but has not injured. Mrs. Slade looked at her,
then at Karl von Rosen. He looked at Mrs. Wilbur Edes, then looked
away. She was most graceful, but most positively uninteresting.
However, Mrs. Slade was rather pleased at that. She and Mrs. Edes
were rival stars. Von Rosen had never looked long at her, and it
seemed right he should not look long at the other woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Slade surveyed Mrs. Edes as she announced the next number on
the programme, and told herself that Mrs. Edes' gown might be real
lace and everything about her very real, and nice, and elegant, but
she was certainly a little fussy for so small a woman. Mrs. Slade
considered that she herself could have carried off that elegance in a
much more queenly manner. There was one feature of Mrs. Edes' costume
which Mrs. Slade resented. She considered that it should be worn by a
woman of her own size and impressiveness. That was a little wrap of
ermine. Now ermine, as everybody knew, should only be worn by large
and queenly women. Mrs. Slade resolved that she herself would have an
ermine wrap which should completely outshine Mrs. Edes' little
affair, all swinging with tails and radiant with tiny, bright-eyed
heads.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edes announced a duet by Miss MacDonald and Mrs. Wells, and
sat down, and again the perfume of rose leaves was perceptible. Karl
von Rosen glanced at the next performers, Miss MacDonald, who was
very pretty and well-dressed in white embroidered cloth, and Mrs.
Wells, who was not pretty, but was considered very striking, who
trailed after her in green folds edged with fur, and bore a roll of
music. She seated herself at the piano with a graceful sweep of her
green draperies, which defined her small hips, and struck the keys
with slender fingers quite destitute of rings, always lifting them
high with a palpable affectation not exactly doubtful&mdash;that was
saying too much&mdash;but she was considered to reach limits of
propriety with her sinuous motions, the touch of her sensitive
fingers upon piano keys, and the quick flash of her dark eyes in her
really plain face. There was, for the women in Fairbridge, a certain
mischievous fascination about Mrs. Wells. Moreover, they had in her
their one object of covert gossip, their one stimulus to unlawful
imagination.</p>

<p>There was a young man who played the violin. His name was Henry
Wheaton, and he was said to be a frequent caller at Mrs. Wells', and
she played his accompaniments, and Mr. Wells was often detained in
New York until the late train. Then there was another young man who
played the 'cello, and he called often. And there was Ellis
Bainbridge, who had a fine tenor voice, and he called. It was
delightful to have a woman of that sort, of whom nothing distinctly
culpable could be affirmed, against whom no good reason could be
brought for excluding her from the Zenith Club and the social set. In
their midst, Mrs. Wells furnished the condiments, the spice, and
pepper, and mustard for many functions. She relieved to a great
extent the monotony of unquestioned propriety. It would have been
horribly dull if there had been no woman in the Zenith Club who
furnished an excuse for the other members' gossip.</p>

<p>Leila MacDonald, so carefully dressed and brushed and washed, and
so free from defects that she was rather irritating, began to sing,
then people listened. Karl von Rosen listened. She really had a voice
which always surprised and charmed with the first notes, then ceased
to charm. Leila MacDonald was as a good canary bird, born to sing,
and dutifully singing, but without the slightest comprehension of her
song. It was odd too that she sang with plenty of expression, but her
own lack of realisation seemed to dull it for her listeners. Karl von
Rosen listened, then his large eyes again turned introspective.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edes again arose, after the singing and playing ladies had
finished their performance and returned to their seats, and announced
a recitation by Miss Sally Anderson. Miss Anderson wore a light
summer gown, and swept to the front, and bent low to her audience,
then at once began her recitation with a loud crash of emotion. She
postured, she gesticulated. She lowered her voice to inaudibility,
she raised it to shrieks and wails. She did everything which she had
been taught, and she had been taught a great deal. Mrs. Sarah Joy
Snyder listened and got data for future lectures, with her mirthful
mouth sternly set.</p>

<p>After Sally Anderson, Mrs. Jack Evarts played a glittering thing
called &ldquo;Waves of the Sea.&rdquo;  Then Sally Anderson recited
again, then Mrs. Wilbur Edes spoke at length, and with an air which
commanded attention, and Von Rosen suffered agonies. He laughed with
sickly spurts at Mrs. Snyder's confidential sallies, when she had at
last her chance to deliver herself of her ten dollar speech, but the
worst ordeal was to follow. Von Rosen was fluttered about by women
bearing cups of tea, of frothy chocolate, plates of cake, dishes of
bonbons, and saucers of ice-cream. He loathed sweets and was forced
into accepting a plate. He stood in the midst of the feminine throng,
the solitary male figure looking at his cup of chocolate, and a slice
of sticky cake, and at an ice representing a chocolate lily, which
somebody had placed for special delectation upon a little table at
his right. Then Alice Mendon came to his rescue.</p>

<p>She deftly took the plate with the sticky cake, and the cup of hot
chocolate, and substituted a plate with a chicken mayonnaise
sandwich, smiling pleasantly as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Why do you make a martyr
of yourself for such a petty cause? Do it for the faith if you want
to, but not for thick chocolate and angel cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swept away the chocolate lily also. Von Rosen looked at her
gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Oh, you need not thank me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I have a natural instinct to rescue men from sweets.&rdquo;
She laughed again maliciously. &ldquo;I am sure you have enjoyed the
club very much,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Von Rosen coloured before her sarcastic, kindly eyes. He began to
speak, but she interrupted him. &ldquo;You have heard that silence is
golden,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is always golden when speech would
be a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she turned away and seized upon the chocolate lily and
pressed it upon Mrs. Joy Snyder, who was enjoying adulation and good
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do please have this lovely lily, Mrs. Snyder,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It is the very prettiest ice of the lot, and meant
especially for you. I am sure you will enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder, whose sense of humour deserted her when
she was being praised and fed, and who had already eaten bonbons
innumerable, and three ices with accompanying cake, took the
chocolate lily gratefully. Von Rosen ate his chicken sandwich and
marvelled at the ways of women.</p>

<p>After Von Rosen had finished his sandwiches and tea, he made his
way to Mrs. Snyder, and complimented her upon her lecture. He had a
constitutional dislike for falsehoods, which was perhaps not so much
a virtue as an idiosyncrasy. Now he told Mrs. Snyder that he had
never heard a lecture which seemed to amuse an audience more than
hers had done, and that he quite envied her because of her power of
holding attention. Mrs. Snyder, with the last petal of her chocolate
lily sweet upon her tongue, listened with such a na&iuml;vet&eacute;
of acquiescence that she was really charming, and Von Rosen had
spoken the truth. He had wondered, when he saw the eagerly tilted
faces of the women, and heard their bursts of shrill laughter and
clapping of hands, why he could not hold them with his sermons which,
he might assume without vanity, contained considerable subject for
thought, as this woman, with her face like a mask of mirth, held them
with her compilation of platitudes.</p>

<p>He thought that he had never seen so many women listen with such
intensity, and lack of self-consciousness. He had seen only two pat
their hair, only one glance at her glittering rings, only three
arrange the skirts of their gowns while the lecture was in progress.
Sometimes during his sermons, he felt as if he were holding forth to
a bewildering sea of motion with steadily recurrent waves, which
fascinated him, of feathers, and flowers, swinging fur tails, and
kid-gloved hands, fluttering ribbons, and folds of drapery. Karl von
Rosen would not have acknowledged himself as a woman-hater, that
savoured too much of absurd male egotism, but he had an under
conviction that women were, on the whole, admitting of course
exceptions, self-centered in the pursuit of petty ends to the extent
of absolute viciousness. He disliked women, although he had never
owned it to himself.</p>

<p>In spite of his dislike of women, Von Rosen had a house-keeper. He
had made an ineffectual trial of an ex-hotel chef, but had finally
been obliged to resort to Mrs. Jane Riggs. She was tall and strong,
wider-shouldered than hipped. She went about her work with long
strides. She never fussed. She never asked questions. In fact, she
seldom spoke.</p>

<p>When Von Rosen entered his house that night, after the club
meeting, he had a comfortable sense of returning to an embodied
silence. The coal fire in his study grate was red and clear.
Everything was in order without misplacement. That was one of Jane
Riggs' chief talents. She could tidy things without misplacing them.
Von Rosen loved order, and was absolutely incapable of keeping it.
Therefore Jane Riggs' orderliness was as balm. He sat down in his
Morris chair before his fire, stretched out his legs to the warmth,
which was grateful after the icy outdoor air, rested his eyes upon a
plaster cast over the chimney place, which had been tinted a
beautiful hue by his own pipe, and sighed with content. His own
handsome face was rosy with the reflection of the fire, his soul
rose-coloured with complete satisfaction. He was so glad to be quit
of that crowded assemblage of eager femininity, so glad that it was
almost worth while to have encountered it just for that sense of
blessed relief.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edes had offered to take him home in her carriage, and he had
declined almost brusquely. To have exchanged that homeward walk over
the glistening earth, and under the clear rose and violet lights of
the winter sunset, with that sudden rapturous discovery of the
slender crescent of the new moon, for a ride with Mrs. Edes in her
closed carriage with her silvery voice in his ear instead of the keen
silence of the winter air, would have been torture. Von Rosen
wondered at himself for disliking Mrs. Edes in particular, whereas he
disliked most women in general. There was something about her feline
motions instinct with swiftness, and concealed claws, and the half
keen, half sleepy glances of her green-blue eyes, which irritated him
beyond measure, and he was ashamed of being irritated. It implied a
power over him, and yet it was certainly not a physical power. It was
subtle and pertained to spirit. He realised, as did many in
Fairbridge, a strange influence, defying reason and will, which this
small woman with her hidden swiftness had over nearly everybody with
whom she came in contact. It had nothing whatever to do with sex. She
would have produced it in the same degree, had she not been in the
least attractive. It was compelling, and at the same time
irritating.</p>

<p>Von Rosen in his Morris chair after the tea welcomed the intrusion
of Jane Riggs, which dispelled his thought of Mrs. Wilbur Edes. Jane
stood beside the chair, a rigid straight length of woman with a white
apron starched like a board, covering two thirds of her, and waited
for interrogation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jane?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen.</p>

<p>Jane Riggs replied briefly. &ldquo;Outlandish young woman out in
the kitchen,&rdquo; she said with distinct disapproval, yet with
evident helplessness before the situation.</p>

<p>Von Rosen started. &ldquo;Where is the dog?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Licking her hands. Every time I told her to go, Jack
growled. Mebbe you had better come out yourself, Mr. Von
Rosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Von Rosen entered the kitchen, he saw a little figure on the
floor in a limp heap, with the dog frantically licking its hands,
which were very small and brown and piteously outspread, as if in
supplication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you had better call up the doctor on the telephone;
she seems to have swooned away,&rdquo; said Jane Riggs. At the same
time she made one long stride to the kitchen sink, and water. Von
Rosen looked aghast at the stricken figure, which was wrapped in a
queer medley of garments. He also saw on the floor near by a bulging
suitcase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is one of them pedlars,&rdquo; said Jane Riggs, dashing
water upon the dumb little face. &ldquo;I rather guess you had better
call up the doctor on the telephone. She don't seem to be coming to
easy and she may have passed away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen gasped, then he looked pitifully at the poor little
figure, and ran back to his study to the telephone. To his great
relief as he passed the window, he glanced out, and saw Doctor
Sturtevant's automobile making its way cautiously over the icy
street. Then for the first time he remembered that he had been due at
that time about a matter of a sick parishioner. He opened the front
door hurriedly, and stated the case, and the two men carried the
little unconscious creature upstairs. Then Von Rosen came down,
leaving the doctor and Martha with her. He waited in the study,
listening to the sounds overhead, waiting impatiently for the
doctor's return, which was not for half an hour or more. In the
meantime Martha came downstairs on some errand to the kitchen. Von
Rosen intercepted her. &ldquo;What does Doctor Sturtevant
think?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno, what he thinks,&rdquo; replied Martha brusquely,
pushing past him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she conscious yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno, I ain't got any time to talk,&rdquo; said Martha,
casting a flaming look at him over her shoulder as she entered the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Von Rosen retreated to the study, where he was presently joined by
the doctor. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen with an
emphasis, which rendered it so suspicious that he might have added:
&ldquo;what the devil is it?&rdquo; had it not been for his
profession.</p>

<p>Sturtevant answered noiselessly, the motion of his lips conveying
his meaning. Then he said, shrugging himself into his fur coat, as he
spoke, &ldquo;I have to rush my motor to see a patient, whom I dare
not leave another moment, then I will be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen's great Persian cat had curled himself on the doctor's
fur coat, and now shaken off, sat with a languid dignity, his great
yellow plume of a tail waving, and his eyes like topazes fixed
intently upon Sturtevant. At that moment a little cry was heard from
the guest room, a cry between a moan and a scream, but unmistakably a
note of suffering. Sturtevant jammed his fur cap upon his head and
pulled on his gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't go,&rdquo; pleaded Von Rosen in a sudden terror of
helplessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, but I'll break the speed laws and be back before
you know it. That housekeeper of yours is as good as any trained
nurse, and better. She is as hard as nails, but she does her duty
like a machine, and she has brains. I will be back in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Sturtevant was gone, and Von Rosen sat again before his study
fire. There was another little note of suffering from above. Von
Rosen shuddered, rose, and closed his door. The Persian cat came and
sat in front of him, and gazed at him with jewel-like eyes. There was
an expression of almost human anxiety and curiosity upon the animal's
face. He came from a highly developed race; he and his forbears had
always been with humans. At times it seemed to Von Rosen as if the
cat had a dumb knowledge of the most that he himself knew. He reached
down and patted the shapely golden head, but the cat withdrew, curled
himself into a coil of perfect luxuriousness, with the firelight
casting a warm, rosy glow upon his golden beauty, purred a little
while, then sank into the mystery of animal sleep.</p>

<p>Von Rosen sat listening. He told himself that Sturtevant should be
back within half an hour. When only ten minutes had passed he took
out his watch and was dismayed to find how short a time had elapsed.
He replaced his watch and leaned back. He was always listening
uneasily. He had encountered illness and death and distress, but
never anything quite like this. He had always been able to give
personal aid. Now he felt barred out, and fiercely helpless.</p>

<p>He sat ten minutes longer. Then he arose. He could reach the
kitchen by another way which did not lead past the stairs. He went
out there, treading on tiptoe. The cat had looked up, stretched, and
lazily gotten upon his feet and followed him, tail waving like a
pennant. He brushed around Von Rosen out in the kitchen, and mewed a
little, delicate, highbred mew. The dog came leaping up the basement
stairs, sat up and begged. Von Rosen opened the ice box and found
therein some steak. He cut off large pieces and fed the cat and dog.
He also found milk and filled a saucer.</p>

<p>He stole back to the study. He thought he had closed all the
doors, but presently the cat entered, then sat down and began to lick
himself with his little red rough tongue. Von Rosen looked at his
watch again. The house shook a little, and he knew that the shaking
was caused by Jane Riggs, walking upstairs. He longed to go upstairs
but knew that he could not, and again that rage of helplessness came
over him. He reflected upon human life, the agony of its beginning;
the agony, in spite of bravery, in spite of denial of agony, the
agony under the brightest of suns, of its endurance; the agony of its
end; and his reflections were almost blasphemous. His religion seemed
to crumble beneath the standing-place of his soul. A torture of
doubt, a certainty of ignorance, in spite of the utmost efforts of
faith, came over him. The cat coiled himself again and sank into
sleep. Von Rosen gazed at him. What if the accepted order of things
were reversed, after all? What if that beautiful little animal were
on a higher plane than he? Certainly the cat did not suffer, and
certainly suffering and doubt degraded even the greatest.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and saw that Sturtevant had been gone five
minutes over the half hour. He switched off the electric light, and
stood in his window, which faced the street down which the doctor in
his car must come. He realised at once that this was more endurable.
He was doing what a woman would have done long before. He was
masculine, and had not the quick instinct to stand by the window and
watch out, to ease impatience. The road was like a broad silver band
under the moon. The lights in house windows gleamed through drawn
shades, except in one house, where he could see quite distinctly a
woman seated beside a lamp with a green shade, sewing, with regular
motions of a red, silk-clad arm. Von Rosen strained his eyes, and
saw, as he thought, a dark bulk advancing far down the street. He
watched and watched, then noted that the dark bulk had not moved. He
wondered if the motor had broken down. He thought of running out to
see, and made a motion to go, then he saw swiftly-moving lights pass
the dark bulk. He thought they were the lights of the motor, but as
they passed he saw it was a cab taking someone to the railroad
station. He knew then that the dark bulk was a clump of trees.</p>

<p>Then, before he could fairly sense it, the doctor's motor came
hurtling down the street, its search-lights glaring, swinging from
side to side. The machine stopped, and Von Rosen ran to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said Sturtevant in a hushed voice. There
was a sound from the room above, and the doctor, Von Rosen and nurse
looked at each other. Then Von Rosen sat again alone in his study,
and now, in spite of the closed door, he heard noises above stairs.
Solitude was becoming frightful to him. He felt all at once strangely
young, like a child, and a pitiful sense of injury was over him, but
the sense of injury was not for himself alone, but for all mankind.
He realised that all mankind was enormously pitiful and injured, by
the mere fact of their obligatory existence. And he wished more than
anything in the world for some understanding soul with whom to share
his sense of the universal grievance.</p>

<p>But he continued to sit alone, and the cat slept in his golden
coil of peace. Then suddenly the cat sat up, and his jewel eyes
glowed. He looked fixedly at a point in the room. Von Rosen looked in
the same direction but saw nothing except his familiar wall. Then he
heard steps on the stairs, and the door opened, and Jane Riggs
entered. She was white and stern. She was tragic. Her lean fingers
were clutching at the air. Von Rosen stared at her. She sat down and
swept her crackling white apron over her head.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter III</h4>

<p>When Margaret Edes had returned home after the Zenith Club, she
devoted an hour to rest. She had ample time for that before dressing
for a dinner which she and her husband were to give in New York that
evening. The dinner was set for rather a late hour in order to enable
Margaret to secure this rest before the train-time. She lay on a
couch before the fire, in her room which was done in white and gold.
Her hair was perfectly arranged, for she had scarcely moved her head
during the club meeting, and had adjusted and removed her hat with
the utmost caution. Now she kept her shining head perfectly still
upon a rather hard pillow. She did not relax her head, but she did
relax her body, and the result, as she was aware, would be
beautifying.</p>

<p>Still as her head remained, she allowed no lines of disturbance to
appear upon her face, and for that matter, no lines of joy. Secretly
she did not approve of smiles, more than she approved of tears. Both
of them, she knew, tended to leave traces, and other people,
especially other women, did not discriminate between the traces of
tears and smiles. Therefore, lying with her slim graceful body
stretched out at full length upon her couch, Margaret Edes' face was
as absolutely devoid of expression as a human face could well be, and
this although she was thinking rather strenuously. She had not been
pleased with the impression which Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder had made upon
the Zenith Club, because Mrs. Slade, and not she, had been
instrumental in securing her valuable services. Mrs. Edes had a
Napoleonic ambition which was tragic and pathetic, because it could
command only a narrow scope for its really unusual force. If Mrs.
Edes had only been possessed of the opportunity to subjugate Europe,
nothing except another Waterloo could have stopped her onward march.
But she had absolutely nothing to subjugate except poor little
Fairbridge. She was a woman of power which was wasted. She was
absurdly tragic, but none the less tragic. Power spent upon petty
ends is one of the greatest disasters of the world. It wrecks not
only the spender, but its object. Mrs. Edes was horribly and
unworthily unhappy, reflecting upon Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder and Mrs.
Slade. She cared very much because Mrs. Slade and not she had brought
about this success of the Zenith Club, with Mrs. Snyder as
high-light. It was a shame to her, but she could not help it, because
one living within narrow horizons must have limited aims.</p>

<p>If only her husband had enough money to enable her to live in New
York after the manner which would have suited her, she felt capable
of being a leading power in that great and dreadful city. Probably
she was right. The woman was in reality possessed of abnormal nerve
force. Had Wilbur Edes owned millions, and she been armed with the
power which they can convey, she might have worked miracles in her
subtle feminine fashion. She would always have worked subtly, and
never believed her feminine self. She understood its worth too well.
She would have conquered like a cat, because she understood her
weapons, her velvet charm, her purr, and her claws. She would not
have attempted a growling and bulky leap into success. She would have
slid and insinuated and made her gliding progress almost
imperceptible, but none the less remorseless.</p>

<p>But she was fated to live in Fairbridge. What else could she do?
Wilbur Edes was successful in his profession, but he was not an
accumulator, and neither was she. His income was large during some
years, but it was spent during those years for things which seemed
absolutely indispensable to both husband and wife. For instance,
to-night Wilbur would spend an extravagant sum upon this dinner,
which he was to give at an extravagant hotel to some people whom Mrs.
Edes had met last summer, and who, if not actually in the great swim,
were in the outer froth of it, and she had vague imaginings of future
gain through them. Wilbur had carried his dress suit in that morning.
He was to take a room in the hotel and change, and meet her at the
New York side of the ferry. As she thought of the ferry it was all
Mrs. Edes could do to keep her smooth brow from a frown. Somehow the
ferry always humiliated her; the necessity of going up or down that
common, democratic gang plank, clinging to the tail of her fine gown,
and seating herself in a row with people who glanced askance at her
evening wrap and her general magnificence.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Edes was so small and slight that holding up
magnificence and treading the deck with her high-heeled shoes was
physically fatiguing. Had she been of a large, powerful physique, had
her body matched her mind, she might not have felt a sense of angry
humiliation. As it was, she realised that for her, <em>her</em>, to
be obliged to cross the ferry was an insult at the hands of
Providence. But the tunnel was no better, perhaps worse,&mdash;that
plunged into depths below the waters, like one in a public bath.
Anything so exquisite, so dainty, so subtly fine and powerful as
herself, should not have been condemned to this. She should have been
able to give her dinners in her own magnificent New York mansion. As
it was, there was nothing for her except to dress and accept the
inevitable.</p>

<p>It was as bad as if Napoleon the Great had been forced to ride to
battle on a trolley car, instead of being booted and spurred and
astride a charger, which lifted one fore-leg in a fling of scorn. Of
course Wilbur would meet her, and they would take a taxicab, but even
a taxicab seemed rather humiliating to her. It should have been her
own private motor car. And she would be obliged to descend the stairs
at the station ungracefully, one hand clutching nervously at the tail
of her gorgeous gown, the other at her evening cloak. It was
absolutely impossible for so slight a woman to descend stairs with
dignity and grace, holding up an evening cloak and a long gown.</p>

<p>However, there would be compensations later. She thought, with
decided pleasure, of the private dining-room, and the carefully
planned and horribly expensive decorations, which would be eminently
calculated to form a suitable background for herself. The flowers and
candle-shades were to be yellow, and she was to wear her yellow
chiffon gown, with touches of gold embroidery, a gold comb set with
topazes in her yellow hair, and on her breast a large, gleaming stone
which was a yellow diamond of very considerable value. Wilbur had
carried in his suit case her yellow satin slippers, her gold-beaded
fan, and the queer little wrap of leopard skin which she herself had
fashioned from a rug which her husband had given her. She had much
skill in fashioning articles for her own adornment as a cat has in
burnishing his fur, and would at any time have sacrificed the
curtains or furniture covers, had they met her needs.</p>

<p>She would not be obliged&mdash;crowning disgrace&mdash;to carry a
bag. All she would need would be her little case for tickets, and her
change purse, and her evening cloak had pockets. The evening cloak
lay beside the yellow chiffon gown, carefully disposed on the bed,
which had a lace counterpane over yellow satin. The cloak was of a
creamy cloth lined with mink, a sumptuous affair, and she had a tiny
mink toque with one yellow rose as head covering.</p>

<p>She glanced approvingly at the rich attire spread upon the bed,
and then thought again of the dreadful ferry, and her undignified hop
across the dirty station to the boat. She longed for the days of
sedan chairs, for anything rather than this. She was an exquisite
lady caught in the toils of modern cheap progress toward all her
pleasures and profits. She did not belong in a democratic country at
all unless she had millions. She was out of place, as much out of
place as a splendid Angora in an alley. Fairbridge to her instincts
was as an alley; yet since it was her alley, she had to make the best
of it. Had she not made the best of it, exalted it, magnified it, she
would have gone mad. Wherefore the triumph of Mrs. Slade in
presenting Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder seemed to her like an affair of
moment. For lack of something greater to hate and rival, she hated
and rivalled Mrs. Slade. For lack of something big over which to
reign, she wished to reign over Fairbridge and the Zenith Club. Mrs.
Slade's perfectly-matched drawing-room took on the semblance of a
throne-room, in which she had seen herself usurped.</p>

<p>Then she thought of the young clergyman, even as he was thinking
of her. She knew perfectly well how he had been trapped, but she
failed to see the slightest humour in it. She had no sense of humour.
She saw only the additional triumph of Mrs. Slade in securing this
rather remarkable man at the Zenith Club, something which she herself
had never been able to do. Von Rosen's face came before her. She
considered it a handsome face, but no man's face could disturb her.
She held her virtue with as nervous a clutch as she held up her fine
gown. To soil either would be injudicious, impolitic, and she never
desired the injudicious and impolitic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a handsome man,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;an
aristocratic-looking man.&rdquo;  Then the telephone bell close
beside her divan rang, and she took up the receiver carefully, not
moving her head, sat up, and put her delicate lips to the speaking
tube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said a voice, and she recognised it as Von
Rosen's although it had an agitated, nervous ring which was foreign
to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said in reply, and the voice
responded with volubility, &ldquo;A girl, a young Syrian girl, is at
my home. She is in a swoon or something. We cannot revive her. Is the
doctor at home? Tell him to hurry over, please. I am Mr. von Rosen.
Tell him to hurry. She may be dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have made a mistake, Mr. von Rosen,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Edes' thin voice, as thin and silvery as a reed. &ldquo;You are
speaking to Mrs. Wilbur Edes. My telephone number is 5R. You
doubtless want Doctor Sturtevant. His number is 51M.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pardon,&rdquo; cried the voice over the telephone.
&ldquo;Sorry to have disturbed you, Mrs. Edes, I
mistook&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice trailed into nothingness. There was a sharp ring. Mrs.
Edes hung up her receiver. She thought slowly that it was a strange
circumstance that Mr. von Rosen should have a fainting or dead young
Syrian girl in his house. Then she rose from the divan, holding her
head very stiffly, and began to dress. She had just enough time to
dress leisurely and catch the train. She called on one of the two
maids to assist her and was quite equipped, even to the little mink
toque, fastened very carefully on her shining head, when there was a
soft push at the door, and her twin daughters, Maida and Adelaide,
entered. They were eight years old, but looked younger. They were
almost exactly alike as to small, pretty features and pale blond
colouring. Maida scowled a little, and Adelaide did not, and people
distinguished them by that when in doubt.</p>

<p>They stood and stared at their mother with a curious expression on
their sharp, delicate little faces. It was not exactly admiration, it
was not wonder, nor envy, nor affection, yet tinctured by all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edes looked at them. &ldquo;Maida,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do
not wear that blue hair-ribbon again. It is soiled. Have you had your
dinners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; responded first one, then the other,
Maida with the frown being slightly in the lead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better go to bed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Edes, and
the two little girls stood carefully aside to allow her to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, children,&rdquo; said Mrs. Edes without turning
her mink-crowned head. The little girls watched the last yellow swirl
of their mother's skirts, disappearing around the stair-landing, then
Adelaide spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to wear red, myself, when I'm grown up,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, just because Jim Carr likes red,&rdquo; retorted Maida.
&ldquo;As for me, I mean to have a gown just like hers, only a little
deeper shade of yellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adelaide laughed, an unpleasantly snarling little laugh.
&ldquo;Ho,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;just because Val Thomas likes
yellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the coloured maid, Emma, who was cross because Mrs. Edes'
evening out had deprived her of her own, and had been ruthlessly
hanging her mistress's gown which she had worn to the club in a wad
on a closet hook, disregarding its perfumed hanger, turned upon
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heah, ye chillun,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;your ma sid for
you to go to baid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each little girl had her white bed with a canopy of pink silk in a
charming room. There were garlands of rosebuds on the wallpaper and
the furniture was covered with rosebud chintz.</p>

<p>While their mother was indignantly sailing across the North River,
her daughters lay awake, building air-castles about themselves and
their boy-lovers, which fevered their imaginations, and aged them
horribly in a spiritual sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amy White's mother plays dominoes with her every
evening,&rdquo; Maida remarked. Her voice sounded incredibly old,
full of faint derisiveness and satire, but absolutely
non-complaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amy White's mother would look awfully funny in a gown like
Mamma's,&rdquo; said Adelaide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is why she plays dominoes with Amy,&rdquo;
said Maida in her old voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't talk any more, Maida, I want to go to
sleep,&rdquo; said Adelaide pettishly, but she was not in the least
sleepy. She wished to return to the air-castle in which she had been
having sweet converse with Jim Carr. This air-castle was the abode of
innocence, but it was not yet time for its building at all. It was
such a little childish creature who lay curled up under the coverlid
strewn with rosebuds that the gates of any air-castle of life and
love, and knowledge, however innocent and ignorant, should have been
barred against her, perhaps with dominoes.</p>

<p>However, she entered in, her soft cheeks burning, and her pulse
tingling, and saw the strange light through its fairy windows, and
her sister also entered her air-castle, and all the time their mother
was sailing across the North River toward the pier where her husband
waited. She kept one gloved hand upon the fold of her gown, ready to
clutch it effectually clear of the dirty deck when the pier was
reached. When she was in the taxicab with Wilbur, she thought again
of Von Rosen. &ldquo;Dominie von Rosen made a mistake,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and called up the wrong number. He wanted Doctor
Sturtevant, and he got me.&rdquo;  Then she repeated the message.
&ldquo;What do you suppose he was doing with a fainting Syrian girl
in his house?&rdquo; she ended.</p>

<p>A chuckle shook the dark bulk in its fur lined coat at her side.
&ldquo;The question is why the Syrian girl chose Von Rosen's house to
faint in,&rdquo; said he lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't be funny, Wilbur,&rdquo; said Margaret.
&ldquo;Have you seen the dining-room? How does it look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it beautiful, and I am sure you will like
it,&rdquo; said Wilbur Edes in the chastened tone which he commonly
used toward his wife. He had learned long ago that facetiousness
displeased her, and he lived only to please her, aside from his
interest in his profession. Poor Wilbur Edes thought his wife very
wonderful, and watched with delight the hats doffed when she entered
the hotel lift like a little beruffled yellow canary. He wished those
men could see her later, when the canary resemblance had altogether
ceased, when she would look tall and slender and lithe in her
clinging yellow gown with the great yellow stone gleaming in her
corsage.</p>

<p>For some reason Margaret Edes held her husband's admiration with a
more certain tenure because she could not be graceful when weighed
down with finery. The charm of her return to grace was a never-ending
surprise. Wilbur Edes loved his wife more comfortably than he loved
his children. He loved them a little uneasily. They were unknown
elements to him, and he sometimes wished that he had more time at
home, to get them firmly fixed in his comprehension. Without the
slightest condemnation of his wife, he had never regarded her as a
woman in whom the maternal was a distinguishing feature. He saw with
approbation the charming externals with which she surrounded their
offspring. It was a gratification to him to be quite sure that
Maida's hair ribbon would always be fresh and tied perkily, and that
Adelaide would be full of dainty little gestures copied from her
mother, but he had some doubts as to whether his wonderful Margaret
might not be too perfect in herself, and too engrossed with the
duties pertaining to perfection to be quite the proper manager of
imperfection and immaturity represented by childhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you leave the children!&rdquo; he inquired when
they were in their bedroom at the hotel, and he was fitting the
yellow satin slippers to his wife's slender silk shod feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children were as well as usual. I told Emma to put them
to bed. Do you think the orchids in the dining-room are the right
shade, Wilbur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure. I am glad that you told Emma to put them
to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always do. Mrs. George B. Slade is most unpleasantly
puffed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because she got Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder to speak to the
club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she do her stunt well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough. Mrs. Slade was so pleased, it was really
offensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilbur Edes had an inspiration. &ldquo;The Fay-Wymans,&rdquo; said
he (the Fay-Wymans were the principal guests of their dinner party),
&ldquo;know a lot of theatrical people. I will see if I can't get
them to induce somebody, say Lydia Greenway, to run out some day; I
suppose it would have to be later on, just after the season, and do a
stunt at the club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be simply charming,&rdquo; cried Margaret,
&ldquo;and I would rather have it in the spring, because everything
looks so much prettier. But don't you think it will be impossible,
Wilbur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not with money as an inducement.&rdquo;  Wilbur had the
pleasant consciousness of an unusually large fee which was sure to be
his own before that future club meeting, and he could see no better
employment for it than to enable his adored wife to outshine Mrs.
George B. Slade. When in New York engaged in his profession, Wilbur
Edes was entirely free from the vortex of Fairbridge, but his wife,
with its terrible eddies still agitating her garments, could suck him
therein, even in the great city. He was very susceptible to her
influence.</p>

<p>Margaret Edes beamed at her husband as he rose. &ldquo;That will
make Marion Slade furious,&rdquo; she said. She extended her feet.
&ldquo;Pretty slippers, aren't they, Wilbur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret was so pleased that she tried to do something very
amiable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was funny, I mean what you said about the Syrian girl
at the Dominie's,&rdquo; she volunteered, and laughed, without making
a crease in her fair little face. She was really adorable, far more
than pretty, leaning back with one slender, yellow-draped leg crossed
over the other, revealing the glittering slippers and one silken
ankle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does sound somewhat queer, a Syrian girl fainting in the
Dominie's house,&rdquo; said Wilbur. &ldquo;She could not have found
a house where her sex, of any nationality, are in less
repute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don't think that Alice Mendon&mdash;?&rdquo;
There was a faint note of jealousy in Margaret's voice, although she
herself had not the slightest interest in Dominie von Rosen or any
man, except her husband; and in him only because he was her husband.
As the husband of her wonderful self, he acquired a certain claim to
respect, even affection, such as she had to bestow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think Alice Mendon would take up with the Dominie,
if he would with her,&rdquo; responded Wilbur Edes hastily. Margaret
did not understand his way of speaking, but just then she looked at
herself in an opposite mirror, and pulled down one side of her blond
pompadour a bit, which softened her face, and added to its
allurement. The truth was Wilbur Edes, before he met Margaret, had
proposed to Alice Mendon. Alice had never told, and he had not,
consequently Margaret did not know. Had she known it would have made
no difference, since she could not imagine any man preferring Alice
to herself. All her jealousy was based upon the facts of her superior
height, and ability to carry herself well, where she knew herself
under many circumstances about as graceful as an Angora cat walking
upon her hind legs. She was absolutely sure of her husband. The
episode with Alice had occurred before he had ever even seen Herself.
She smiled radiantly upon him as she arose. She was conscious of no
affection for her husband, but she was conscious of a desire to show
appreciation, and to display radiance for his delectation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is charming of you to think of getting Lydia Greenway to
read, you dear old man,&rdquo; said she. Wilbur beamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I can not be sure, that is not absolutely
sure, but if it is to be done, I will manage it,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>It was at this very time, for radically different notes sound at
the same time in the harmony or discord of life, that Von Rosen's
housekeeper, Jane Riggs, stood before him with that crackling white
apron swept over her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen, and he realised that
his lips were stiff, and his voice sounded strange.</p>

<p>A strange harsh sob came from behind the apron. &ldquo;She was all
bent to one side with that heavy suit case, as heavy as lead, for I
hefted it,&rdquo; said Jane Riggs, &ldquo;and she couldn't have been
more than fifteen. Them outlandish girls get married awful
young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there was poor Jack lickin' her hands, and him a dog
everybody is so scared of, and she a sinkin' down in a heap on my
kitchen floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has passed away,&rdquo; answered Jane Riggs,
&ldquo;and&mdash;the baby is a boy, and no bigger than the cat, not
near as big as the cat when I come to look at him, and I put some of
my old flannels and my shimmy on him, and Doctor Sturtevant has got
him in my darning basket, all lined with newspapers, the New York
<i>Sun</i>, and the <i>Times</i> and hot water bottles, and it's all
happened in the best chamber, and I call it pretty goings
on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane Riggs gave vent to discordant sobs. Her apron crackled. Von
Rosen took hold of her shoulders. &ldquo;Go straight back up
there,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn't she have gone in and fainted away somewhere
where there was more women than one,&rdquo; said Jane Riggs.
&ldquo;Doctor Sturtevant, he sent me down for more
newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take these, and go back at once,&rdquo; said Von Rosen, and
he gathered up the night papers in a crumpled heap and thrust them
upon the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said you had better telephone for Mrs. Bestwick,&rdquo;
said Jane. Mrs. Bestwick was the resident nurse of Fairbridge. Von
Rosen sprang to the telephone, but he could get no response whatever
from the Central office, probably on account of the ice-coated
wires.</p>

<p>He sat down disconsolately, and the cat leapt upon his knees, but
he pushed him away impatiently, to be surveyed in consequence by
those topaz eyes with a regal effect of injury, and astonishment. Von
Rosen listened. He wondered if he heard, or imagined that he heard, a
plaintive little wail. The dog snuggled close to him, and he felt a
warm tongue lap. Von Rosen patted the dog's head. Here was sympathy.
The cat's leap into his lap had been purely selfish. Von Rosen
listened. He got up, and tried to telephone again, but got no
response from Central. He hung up the receiver emphatically and sat
down again. The dog again came close, and he patted the humble loving
head. Von Rosen listened again, and again could not be sure whether
he actually heard or imagined that he heard, the feeblest, most
helpless cry ever lifted up from this earth, that of a miserable new
born baby with its uncertain future reaching before it and all the
sins of its ancestors upon its devoted head.</p>

<p>When at last the door opened and Doctor Sturtevant entered, he was
certain. That poor little atom of humanity upstairs was lifting up
its voice of feeble rage and woe because of its entrance into
existence. Sturtevant had an oddly apologetic look. &ldquo;I assure
you I am sorry, my dear fellow&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the poor little beggar going to live?&rdquo; asked Von
Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I think so, judging from the present
outlook,&rdquo; replied the doctor still apologetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not get Mrs. Bestwick,&rdquo; said Von Rosen
anxiously. &ldquo;I think the telephone is out of commission, on
account of the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. Your housekeeper is a jewel, and I will
get Mrs. Bestwick on my way home. I say, Von Rosen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, never mind; I really must be off now,&rdquo; said
the doctor hurriedly. &ldquo;I will get Mrs. Bestwick here as soon as
possible. I think&mdash;the child will have to be kept here for a
short time anyway, considering the weather, and
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Von Rosen.</p>

<p>After the doctor had gone, he went out in the kitchen. He had had
no dinner. Jane Riggs, who had very acute hearing, came to the head
of the stairs, and spoke in a muffled tone, muffled as Von Rosen knew
because of the presence of death and life in the house. &ldquo;The
roast is in the oven, Mr. von Rosen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I
certainly hope it isn't too dry, and the soup is in the kettle, and
the vegetables are all ready to dish up. Everything is ready except
the coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I can make that,&rdquo; called Von Rosen in alarm.
&ldquo;Don't think of coming down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen could make very good coffee. It was an accomplishment of
his college days. He made some now. He felt the need of it. Then he
handily served the very excellent dinner, and sat down at his
solitary dining table. As he ate his soup, he glanced across the
table, and a blush like that of a girl overspread his dark face. He
had a vision of a high chair, and a child installed therein with the
customary bib and spoon. It was a singular circumstance, but
everything in life moves in sequences, and that poor Syrian child
upstairs, in her dire extremity, was furnishing a sequence in the
young man's life, before she went out of it. Her stimulation of his
sympathy and imagination was to change the whole course of his
existence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Doctor Sturtevant was having a rather strenuous
argument with his wife, who for once stood against him. She had her
not-to-be-silenced personal note. She had a horror of the alien and
unusual. All her life she had walked her chalk-line, and anything
outside savoured of the mysterious, and terrible. She was
Anglo-Saxon. She was what her ancestresses had been for generations.
The strain was unchanged, and had become so tense and narrow that it
was almost fathomless. Mrs. Sturtevant, good and benevolent on her
chalk-line, was involuntarily a bigot. She looked at Chinese laundry
men, poor little yellow figures, shuffling about with bags of soiled
linen, with thrills of recoil. She would not have acknowledged it to
herself, for she came of a race which favoured abolition, but nothing
could have induced her to have a coloured girl in her kitchen. Her
imaginations and prejudices were stained as white as her skin. There
was a lone man living on the outskirts of Fairbridge, in a little
shack built by himself in the woods, who was said to have Indian
blood in his veins, and Mrs. Sturtevant never saw him without that
awful thrill of recoil. When the little Orientals, men or women,
swayed sidewise and bent with their cheap suitcases filled with
Eastern handiwork, came to the door, she did not draw a long breath
until she had watched them out of sight down the street. It made no
difference to her that they might be Christians, that they might have
suffered persecution in their own land and sought our doorless
entrances of hospitality; she still realised her own aloofness from
them, or rather theirs from her. They had entered existence entirely
outside her chalk-line. She and they walked on parallels which to all
eternity could never meet.</p>

<p>It therefore came to pass that, although she had in the secret
depths of her being bemoaned her childlessness, and had been
conscious of yearnings and longings which were agonies, when Doctor
Sturtevant, after the poor young unknown mother had been laid away in
the Fairbridge cemetery, proposed that they should adopt the bereft
little one, she rebelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were a white baby, I wouldn't object that I know
of,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I can't have this kind. I can't make
up my mind to it, Edward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Maria, the child is white. He may not be European, but
he is white. That is, while of course he has a dark complexion and
dark eyes and hair, he is as white, in a way, as any child in
Fairbridge, and he will be a beautiful boy. Moreover, we have every
reason to believe that he was born in wedlock. There was a ring on a
poor string of a ribbon on the mother's neck, and there was a
fragment of a letter which Von Rosen managed to make out. He thinks
that the poor child was married to another child of her own race. The
boy is all right and he will be a fine little fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use,&rdquo; said Maria Sturtevant. &ldquo;I
can't make up my mind to adopt a baby, that belonged to that kind of
people. I simply can not, Edward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sturtevant gave up the matter for the time being. The baby
remained at Von Rosen's under the care of Mrs. Bestwick, and Jane
Riggs, but when it was a month old, the doctor persuaded his wife to
go over and see it. Maria Sturtevant gazed at the tiny scrap of
humanity curled up in Jane Riggs' darning basket, the old-young face
creased as softly as a rosebud, with none of its beauty, but with a
compelling charm. She watched the weak motion of the infinitesimal
legs and arms beneath the soft smother of wrappings, and her heart
pained her with longing, but she remained firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use, Edward,&rdquo; she said, when they had
returned to Von Rosen's study. &ldquo;I can't make up my mind to
adopt a baby coming from such queer people.&rdquo;  Then she was
confronted by a stare of blank astonishment from Von Rosen, and also
from Jane Riggs.</p>

<p>Jane Riggs spoke with open hostility. &ldquo;I don't know that
anybody has asked anybody to adopt our baby,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed, but he also blushed. He spoke rather
stammeringly. &ldquo;Well, Sturtevant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
fact is, Jane and I have talked it over, and she thinks she can
manage, and he seems a bright little chap, and&mdash;I have about
made up my mind to keep him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going to be baptised as soon as he is big enough to
be taken out of my darning basket,&rdquo; said Jane Riggs with
defiance, but Mrs. Sturtevant regarded her with relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say he will be a real comfort to you,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;even if he does come from such queer stock.&rdquo;  Her
husband looked at Von Rosen and whistled under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People will talk,&rdquo; he said aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; returned Von Rosen. He was experiencing a
strange new joy of possession, which no possibility of ridicule could
daunt. However, his joy was of short duration. The baby was a little
over three months old, and had been promoted to a crib, and a
perambulator, had been the unconscious recipient of many gifts from
the women of Von Rosen's parish, and of many calls from admiring
little girls. Jane had scented the danger. She came home from
marketing one morning, quite pale, and could hardly speak when she
entered Von Rosen's study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's an outlandish young man around here,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and you had better keep that baby close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed. &ldquo;Those people are always about,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You have no reason to be nervous, Jane. There is hardly
a chance he has anything to do with the baby, and in any case, he
would not be likely to burden himself with the care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you be too sure,&rdquo; said Jane stoutly, &ldquo;a
baby like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane, much against her wishes, was obliged to go out that
afternoon, and Von Rosen was left alone with the baby with the
exception of a little nurse girl who had taken the place of Mrs.
Bestwick. Then it was that the Syrian man, he was no more than a boy,
came. Von Rosen did not at first suspect. The Syrian spoke very good
English, and he was a Christian. So he told Von Rosen. Then he also
told him that the dead girl had been his wife, and produced letters
signed with the name which those in her possession had borne. Von
Rosen was convinced. There was something about the boy with his
haughty, almost sullen, oriental manner which bore the stamp of
truth. However, when he demanded only the suit-case which his dead
wife had brought when she came to the house, Von Rosen was relieved.
He produced it at once, and his wonder and disgust mounted to fever
heat, when that Eastern boy proceeded to take out carefully the gauds
of feminine handiwork which it contained, and press them upon Von
Rosen at exorbitant prices. Von Rosen was more incensed than he often
permitted himself to be. He ordered the boy from the house, and he
departed with strong oaths, and veiled and intricate threats after
the manner of his subtle race, and when Jane Riggs came home, Von
Rosen told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I firmly believe the young rascal was that poor girl's
husband, and the boy's father,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't he ask to have the baby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mentioned such a thing. All he wanted was the article
of value which the poor girl left here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane Riggs also looked relieved. &ldquo;Outlandish people are
queer,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But the next morning she rushed into Von Rosen's room when he had
barely finished dressing, sobbing aloud like a child, her face
rigidly convulsed with grief, and her hands waving frantically with
no effort to conceal it.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter IV</h4>

<p>The little Syrian baby had disappeared. Nobody had reckoned with
the soft guile of a race as supple and silent as to their real
intentions as cats. There was a verandah column wound with a massive
wistaria vine near the window of the baby's room. The little nurse
girl went home every night, and Jane Riggs was a heavy sleeper. When
she had awakened, her first glance had been into the baby's crib.
Then she sprang, and searched with hungry hands. The little softly
indented nest was not warm, the child had been gone for some hours,
probably had been taken during the first and soundest sleep of the
household. Jane's purse, and her gold breast pin, had incidentally
been taken also. When she gave the alarm to Von Rosen, a sullen,
handsome Syrian boy was trudging upon an unfrequented road, which led
circuitously to the City, and he carried a suit-case, but it was held
apart, by some of the Eastern embroideries used as wedges, before
strapping, and from that came the querulous wail of a baby squirming
uncomfortably upon drawn work centre pieces, and crepe kimonas. Now
and then the boy stopped and spoke to the baby in a lovely gentle
voice. He promised it food, and shelter soon in his own soft tongue.
He was carrying it to his wife's mother, and sullen as he looked and
was, and thief as he was, love for his own swayed him, and made him
determined to hold it fast. Von Rosen made all possible inquiries. He
employed detectives but he never obtained the least clue to the
whereabouts of the little child. He, however, although he grieved
absurdly, almost as absurdly as Jane, had a curious sense of joy over
the whole. Life in Fairbridge had, before birth and death entered his
home, been so monotonous, that he was almost stupefied. Here was a
thread of vital gold and flame, although it had brought pain with it.
When Doctor Sturtevant condoled with him, he met with an unexpected
response. &ldquo;I feel for you, old man. It was a mighty unfortunate
thing that it happened in your house, now that this has come of
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad it happened, whatever came of it,&rdquo;
said Von Rosen. &ldquo;It is something to have had in my life. I
wouldn't have missed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbridge people, who were on the whole a good-natured set, were
very sympathetic, especially the women. Bessy Dicky shed tears when
talking to Mrs. Sturtevant about the disappearance of the baby. Mrs.
Sturtevant was not very responsive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be all for the best,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nobody
can tell how that child would have turned out. He might have ended by
killing Mr. von Rosen.&rdquo;  Then she added with a sigh that she
hoped his poor mother had been married.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course she was since there was a baby,&rdquo; said
Bessy Dicky. Then she rose hastily with a blush because Doctor
Sturtevant's motor could be heard, and took her leave.</p>

<p>Doctor Sturtevant had just returned from a call upon Margaret
Edes, who had experienced a very severe disappointment, coming as it
did after another very successful meeting of the Zenith Club at Daisy
Shaw's, who had most unexpectedly provided a second cousin who
recited monologues wonderfully. Wilbur had failed in his attempt to
secure Lydia Greenway for Margaret's star-feature. The actress had
promised, but had been suddenly attacked with a very severe cold
which had obliged her to sail for Europe a week earlier than she had
planned. Margaret had been quite ill, but Doctor Sturtevant gave her
pain pellets with the result that late in the afternoon she sat on
her verandah in a fluffy white tea gown, and then it was that little
Annie Eustace came across the street, and sat with her. Annie was not
little. Although slender, she was, in fact, quite tall and wide
shouldered and there was something about her which seemed to justify
the use of the diminutive adjective. Possibly it was her face, which
was really small and very pretty, with perfect cameo-like features
and an odd, deprecating, almost painfully humble expression. It was
the face of a creature entirely capable of asking an enemy's pardon
for an injury inflicted upon herself. In reality, Annie Eustace had
very much that attitude of soul. She always considered the wrong as
her natural place, and, in fact, would not have been comfortable
elsewhere, although she suffered there. And yet, little Annie Eustace
was a gifted creature. There was probably not a person in Fairbridge
who had been so well endowed by nature, but her environment and
up-bringing had been unfortunate. If Annie's mother had lived, the
daughter might have had more spirit, but she had died when Annie was
a baby, and the child had been given over to the tyranny of two
aunts, and a grandmother. As for her father, he had never married
again, but he had never paid much attention to her. He had been a
reserved, silent man, himself under the sway of his mother and
sisters. Charles Eustace had had an obsession to the effect that the
skies of his own individual sphere would fall to his and his child's
destruction, if his female relatives deserted him, and that they had
threatened to do, upon the slightest sign of revolt. Sometimes
Annie's father had regarded her wistfully and wondered within himself
if it were quite right for a child to be so entirely governed, but
his own spirit of yielding made it impossible for him to realise the
situation. Obedience had been little Annie Eustace's first lesson
taught by the trio, who to her represented all government, in her
individual case.</p>

<p>Annie Eustace obeyed her aunts, and grandmother (her father had
been dead for several years), but she loved only three,&mdash;two
were women, Margaret Edes and Alice Mendon; the other was a man, and
the love was not confessed to her own heart.</p>

<p>This afternoon Annie wore an ugly green gown, which was, moreover,
badly cut. The sleeves were too long below the elbow, and too short
above, and every time she moved an arm they hitched uncomfortably.
The neck arrangement was exceedingly unbecoming, and the skirt not
well hung. The green was of the particular shade which made her look
yellow. As she sat beside Margaret and embroidered assiduously, and
very unskilfully, some daisies on a linen centre-piece, the other
woman eyed her critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not wear that shade of green, if you will excuse
my saying so, dear,&rdquo; she remarked presently.</p>

<p>Annie regarded her with a charming, loving smile. She would have
excused her idol for saying anything. &ldquo;I know it is not very
becoming,&rdquo; she agreed sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becoming,&rdquo; said Margaret a trifle viciously. She was
so out of sorts about her failure to secure Lydia Greenway that she
felt a great relief in attacking little Annie Eustace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Becoming,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It actually makes you
hideous. That shade is impossible for you and why,&mdash;I trust you
will not be offended, you know it is for your own good,
dear,&mdash;why do you wear your hair in that fashion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is not very becoming,&rdquo; said Annie with
the meekness of those who inherit the earth. She did not state that
her aunt Harriet had insisted that she dress her hair in that
fashion. Annie was intensely loyal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;unless she were as
beautiful as Helen of Troy, should wear her hair that way, and not
look a fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie Eustace blushed, but it was not a distressed blush. When one
has been downtrodden one's whole life, one becomes accustomed to it,
and besides she loved the down-treader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I looked at myself in my glass
just before I came and I thought I did not look well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hideous,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>

<p>Annie smiled agreement and looked pretty, despite the fact that
her hair was strained tightly back, showing too much of her
intellectual forehead, and the colour of her gown killed all the pink
bloom lights in her face. Annie Eustace had a beautiful soul and it
showed forth triumphant over all bodily accessories, in her
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not doing that embroidery at all well,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>

<p>Annie laughed. &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she said with a sort of
meek amusement. &ldquo;I don't think I ever can master long and short
stitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why on earth do you attempt it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody embroiders,&rdquo; replied Annie. She did not
state that her grandmother had made taking the embroidery a condition
of her call upon her friend.</p>

<p>Margaret continued to regard her. She was finding a species of
salve for her own disappointment in this irritant applied to another.
&ldquo;What does make you wear that hair ring?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a present,&rdquo; replied Annie humbly, but she for
the first time looked a little disturbed. That mourning emblem with
her father's and mother's, and a departed sister's hair in a neat
little twist under a small crystal, grated upon her incessantly. It
struck her as a species of ghastly sentiment, which at once
distressed, and impelled her to hysterical mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A present,&rdquo; repeated Margaret. &ldquo;If anybody gave
me such a present as that, I would never wear it. It is simply in
shocking bad taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sometimes fear so,&rdquo; said Annie. She did not state
that her Aunt Jane never allowed her to be seen in public without
that dismal adornment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a queer girl,&rdquo; said Margaret, and she summed
up all her mood of petty cruelty and vicarious revenge in that one
word &ldquo;queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, little Annie Eustace only smiled as if she had been given
a peculiarly acceptable present. She was so used to being underrated,
that she had become in a measure immune to criticism, and besides
criticism from her adored Mrs. Edes was even a favour. She took
another bungling stitch in the petal of a white floss daisy.</p>

<p>Margaret felt suddenly irritated. All this was too much like
raining fierce blows upon a down pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, for goodness sake, Annie Eustace, stop doing that awful
embroidery if you don't want to drive me crazy,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Then Annie looked at Margaret, and she was obviously distressed
and puzzled. Her grandmother had enjoined it upon her to finish just
so many of these trying daisies before her return and yet, on the
other hand, here was Margaret, her adorable Margaret, forbidding her
to work, and, moreover, Margaret in such an irritable mood, with that
smooth brow of hers frowning, and that sweet voice, which usually had
a lazy trickle like honey, fairly rasping, was as awe-inspiring as
her grandmother. Annie Eustace hesitated for a second. Her
grandmother had commanded. Margaret Edes had commanded. The strongest
impulse of her whole being was obedience, but she loved Margaret, and
she did not love her grandmother. She had never confessed such a
horror to herself, but one does not love another human being whose
main aim toward one is to compress, to stiffen, to make move in a
step with itself. Annie folded up the untidy embroidery. As she did
so, she dropped her needle and also her thimble. The needle lay
glittering beside her chair, the thimble rolled noiselessly over the
trailing fold of her muslin gown into the folds of Margaret's white
silk. Margaret felt an odd delight in that. Annie was careless, and
she was dainty, and she was conscious of a little pleasurable
preening of her own soul-plumage.</p>

<p>Margaret said nothing about the thimble and needle. Annie sat
regarding her with a sort of expectation, and the somewhat mussy
little parcel of linen lay in her lap. Annie folded over it her very
slender hands, and the horrible hair ring was in full evidence.</p>

<p>Margaret fixed her eyes upon it. Annie quickly placed the hand
which wore it under the other. Then she spoke, since Margaret did
not, and she said exactly the wrong thing. The being forced
continually into the wrong, often has the effect of making one quite
innocently take the first step in that direction even if no force be
used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that the last meeting of the Zenith Club was
unusually interesting,&rdquo; said little Annie Eustace, and she
could have said nothing more hapless to Margaret Edes in her present
mood. Quite inadvertently, she herself became the irritant party.
Margaret actually flushed. &ldquo;I failed to see anything
interesting whatever about it, myself,&rdquo; said she tartly.</p>

<p>Annie offended again. &ldquo;I heard that Mrs. Sarah Joy Snyder's
address was really very remarkable,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was simply a very stupid effort to be funny,&rdquo;
returned Margaret. &ldquo;Sometimes women will laugh because they are
expected to, and they did that afternoon. Everything was simply cut
and dried. It always is at Mrs. George B. Slade's. I never knew a
woman so absolutely destitute of originality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked helplessly at Margaret. She could say no more unless
she contradicted. Margaret continued. She felt that she could no
longer conceal her own annoyance, and she was glad of this adoring
audience of one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had planned something myself for the next meeting,
something which has never been done,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;something new, and stimulating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely!&rdquo; cried Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course, like all really clever plans for the real
good and progress of a club like ours, something has to come up to
prevent,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I had planned to have Lydia Greenway, you know she is
really a great artist, come to the next meeting and give dramatic
recitations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, would she?&rdquo; gasped Annie Eustace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it would have meant a large pecuniary
outlay,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but I was prepared, quite
prepared, to make some sacrifices for the good of the club, but, why,
you must have read it in the papers, Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked guiltily ignorant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really do not see how you contrive to exist without
keeping more in touch with the current events,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>

<p>Annie looked meekly culpable, although she was not. Her aunts did
not approve of newspapers, as containing so much information, so much
cheap information concerning the evil in the world, especially for a
young person like Annie, and she was not allowed to read them,
although she sometimes did so surreptitiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in all the papers,&rdquo; continued Margaret, with
her censorious air. &ldquo;Lydia Greenway was obliged to leave
unexpectedly and go to the Riveria. They fear tuberculosis. She
sailed last Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; said Annie. Then she proceeded to
elaborate her statement in exactly the wrong way. She said how very
dreadful it would be if such a talented young actress should fall a
victim of such a terrible disease, and what a loss she would be to
the public, whereas all that Margaret Edes thought should be at all
considered by any true friend of her own was her own particular
loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For once the Zenith Club would have had a meeting
calculated to take Fairbridge women out of their rut in which people
like Mrs. Slade and Mrs. Sturtevant seem determined to keep
them,&rdquo; returned Margaret testily. Annie stared at her. Margaret
often said that it was the first rule of her life never to speak ill
of any one, and she kept the letter of it as a rule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; said Annie. Then she added with more
tact. &ldquo;It would have been such a wonderful thing for us all to
have had Lydia Greenway give dramatic recitals to us. Oh, Margaret, I
can understand how much it would have meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have meant progress,&rdquo; said Margaret. She
looked imperiously lovely, as she sat there all frilled about with
white lace and silk with the leaf-shadows playing over the slender
whiteness. She lifted one little hand tragically.
&ldquo;Progress,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Progress beyond Mrs.
George B. Slade's and Mrs. Sturtevant's and Miss Bessy Dicky's, and
that is precisely what we need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie Eustace gazed wistfully upon her friend. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she agreed, &ldquo;you are quite right, Margaret. Mrs. Slade and Mrs.
Sturtevant and poor Bessy Dicky and all the other members are very
good, and we think highly of them, but I too feel that we all travel
in a rut sometimes. Perhaps we all walk too much the same way.&rdquo;
 Then suddenly Annie burst into a peal of laughter. She had a sense
of humour which was startling. It was the one thing which environment
had not been able to subdue, or even produce the effect of
submission. Annie Eustace was easily amused. She had a scent for the
humorous like a hound's for game, and her laugh was
irrepressible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you laughing at now?&rdquo; inquired
Margaret Edes irritably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; Annie replied chokingly, &ldquo;of
some queer long-legged birds I saw once in a cage in a park. I really
don't know whether they were ibises or cranes, or survivals of
species, but anyway, the little long-legged ones all walked just the
same way in a file behind a tall long-legged one, who walked
precisely in the same way, and all of a sudden, I seemed to see us
all like that. Only you are not in the least like that tall,
long-legged bird, Margaret, and you are the president of the Zenith
Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret surveyed Annie with cool displeasure. &ldquo;I,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;see nothing whatever to laugh at in the Zenith Club,
if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I don't!&rdquo; cried Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my mind, the Zenith Club is the one institution in this
little place which tends to advancement and mental
improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Margaret, I think so too, you know I do,&rdquo; said
Annie in a shocked voice. &ldquo;And my heart was almost broken
because I had to miss that last meeting on account of grandmother's
having such a severe cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last meeting was not very much to miss,&rdquo; said
Margaret, for Annie had again said the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Annie, however, went on eagerly and unconsciously. She was only
aware that she was being accused of disloyalty, or worse, of actually
poking fun, when something toward which she felt the utmost respect
and love and admiration was concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret, you know,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you know how I
feel toward the Zenith Club. You must know what it means to me. It
really does take me out of my little narrow place in life as nothing
else does. I cannot tell you what an inspiration it really is to me.
Oh, Margaret, you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret nodded in stiff assent. As a matter of fact, she
<em>did</em> know. The Zenith Club of Fairbridge did mean very much,
very much indeed, to little Annie Eustace. Nowhere else did she meet
<i>en masse</i> others of her kind. She did not even go to church for
the reason that her grandmother did not believe in church going at
all and wished her to remain with her. One aunt was Dutch Reformed
and the other Baptist; and neither ever missed a service. Annie
remained at home Sundays, and read aloud to her grandmother, and when
both aunts were in the midst of their respective services, and the
cook, who was intensely religious, engaged in preparing dinner, she
and her old grandmother played pinocle. However, although Annie
played cards very well, it was only with her relatives. She had never
been allowed to join the Fairbridge Card Club. She never attended a
play in the city, because Aunt Jane considered plays wicked. It was
in reality doubtful if she would have been permitted to listen to
Lydia Greenway, had that person been available. Annie's sole large
recreation was the Zenith Club, and it meant, as she had said, much
to her. It was to the stifled young heart as a great wind of stimulus
which was for the strengthening of her soul. Whatever the Zenith Club
of Fairbridge was to others, it was very much worth while for little
Annie Eustace. She wrote papers for it, which were astonishing,
although her hearers dimly appreciated the fact, not because of
dulness, but because little Annie had written them, and it seemed
incredible to Fairbridge women that little Annie Eustace whom they
had always known, and whose grandmother and aunts they knew, could
possibly write anything remarkable. It was only Alice Mendon who
listened with a frown of wonder, and intent eyes upon the reader.
When she came home upon one occasion, she remarked to her aunt, Eliza
Mendon, and her cousin, Lucy Mendon, that she had been impressed by
Annie Eustace's paper, but both women only stared and murmured
assent. The cousin was very much older than Alice, and both she and
her mother were of a placid, reflective type. They got on very well
with Alice, but sometimes she had a queer weariness from always
seeing herself and her own ideas in them instead of their own. And
she was not in the least dictatorial. She would have preferred open,
antagonistic originality, but she got a surfeit of clear, mirror-like
peace.</p>

<p>She was quite sure that they would quote her opinion of Annie
Eustace's paper, but that did not please her. Later on she spoke to
Annie herself about it. &ldquo;Haven't you something else written
that you can show me?&rdquo;  She had even suggested the possibility,
the desirability, of Annie's taking up a literary career, but she had
found the girl very evasive, even secretive, and had never broached
the subject again.</p>

<p>As for Margaret Edes, she had never fairly listened to anything
which anybody except herself had written, unless it had afforded
matter for discussion, and the display of her own brilliancy. Annie's
productions were so modestly conclusive as to apparently afford no
standing ground for argument. In her heart, Margaret regarded them as
she regarded Annie's personality, with a contempt so indifferent that
it was hardly contempt.</p>

<p>She proceeded exactly as if Annie had not made such a fervent
disclaimer. &ldquo;The Zenith Club is the one and only thing which
lifts Fairbridge, and the women of Fairbridge, above the common
herd,&rdquo; said she majestically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't I know it? Oh, Margaret, don't I know it,&rdquo;
cried the other with such feverish energy that Margaret regarded her
wonderingly. For all her exploiting of the Zenith Club of Fairbridge,
she herself, unless she were the main figure at the helm, could
realise nothing in it so exceedingly inspiring, but it was otherwise
with Annie. It was quite conceivable that had it not been for the
Zenith Club, she never would have grown to her full mental height.
Annie Eustace had a mind of the sequential order. By subtle
processes, unanalysable even by herself, even the record of Miss
Bessy Dicky started this mind upon momentous trains of thought.
Unquestionably the Zenith Club acted as a fulminate for little Annie
Eustace. To others it might seem, during some of the sessions, as a
pathetic attempt of village women to raise themselves upon tiptoes
enough to peer over their centuries of weedy feminine growth; an
attempt which was as futile, and even ridiculous, as an attempt of a
cow to fly. But the Zenith Club justified its existence nobly in the
result of little Annie Eustace, if in no other, and it, no doubt,
justified itself in others. Who can say what that weekly gathering
meant to women who otherwise would not move outside their little
treadmill of household labour, what uplifting, if seemingly futile
grasps at the great outside of life? Let no one underrate the Women's
Club until the years have proven its uselessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry about Lydia Greenway,&rdquo; said Annie, and
this time she did not irritate Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem as if one were simply doomed to failure every
time one really made an effort to raise standards,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>

<p>Then it was that Annie all unconsciously sowed a seed which led to
strange, and rather terrifying results. &ldquo;It would be
nice,&rdquo; said little Annie, &ldquo;if we could get Miss Martha
Wallingford to read a selection from <i>Hearts Astray</i> at a
meeting of the club. I read a few nights ago, in a paper I happened
to pick up at Alice's, that she was staying in New York at the
Hollingsgate. Her publishers were to give her a dinner last night, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret Edes started. &ldquo;I had not seen that,&rdquo; she
said. Then she added in a queer brooding fashion, &ldquo;That book of
hers had an enormous sale. I suppose her publishers feel that they
owe it to her to give her a good time in New York. Then, too, it will
advertise <i>Hearts Astray</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like the book?&rdquo; asked Annie rather
irrelevantly. Margaret did not reply. She was thinking intently.
&ldquo;It would be a great feature for the club if we could induce
her to give a reading,&rdquo; she said at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't suppose it would be possible,&rdquo; replied Annie.
&ldquo;You know they say she never does such things, and is very
retiring. I read in the papers that she was, and that she refused
even to speak a few words at the dinner given in her
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might ask her,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that she would not come. The paper stated that
she had had many invitations to Women's Clubs and had refused. I
don't think she ought because she might be such a help to other
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret said nothing. She leaned back, and, for once, her face
was actually contracted with thought to the possible detriment of its
smooth beauty.</p>

<p>A clock in the house struck, and at the same time Maida and
Adelaide raced up the steps, followed by gleeful calls from two
little boys on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; asked Margaret. Then she said
without waiting for a reply, &ldquo;If Martha Wallingford would come,
I should prefer that to Lydia Greenway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maida and Adelaide, flushed and panting, and both with mouths full
of candy, glanced at their mother, then Maida chased Adelaide into
the house, their blue skirts flitting out of sight like blue
butterfly wings.</p>

<p>Annie Eustace rose. She had noticed that neither Maida nor
Adelaide had greeted her, and thought them rude. She herself had been
most carefully trained concerning manners of incoming and outgoing.
She, however, did not care. She had no especial love for children
unless they were small and appealing because of helplessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is six o'clock,
supper will be ready.&rdquo;  She glanced rather apprehensively as
she spoke at the large white house, not two minutes' walk distant
across the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very delightful it is to be as punctual as your people
are,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Good-bye, Annie.&rdquo;  She spoke
abstractedly, and Annie felt a little hurt. She loved Margaret, and
she missed her full attention when she left her. She passed down the
walk between Margaret's beautifully kept Japanese trees, and gained
the sidewalk. Then a sudden recollection filled her with dismay. She
had promised her grandmother to go to the post-office before
returning. An important business letter was expected. Annie swept the
soft tail of her muslin into a little crushed ball, and ran, her
slender legs showing like those of a young bird beneath its fluff of
plumage. She realized the necessity of speed, of great speed, for the
post-office was a quarter of a mile away, and the Eustace family
supped at five minutes past six, with terrible and relentless
regularity. Why it should have been five minutes past instead of upon
the stroke of the hour, Annie had never known, but so it was. It was
as great an offence to be a minute too early as a minute too late at
the Eustace house, and many a maid had been discharged for that
offence, her plea that the omelet was cooked and would fall if the
meal be delayed, being disregarded. Poor Annie felt that she must
hasten. She could not be dismissed like the maid, but something
equally to be dreaded would happen, were she to present herself half
a minute behind time in the dining-room. There they would be seated,
her grandmother, her Aunt Harriet, and her Aunt Jane. Aunt Harriet
behind the silver tea service; Aunt Jane behind the cut glass bowl of
preserves; her grandmother behind the silver butter dish, and on the
table would be the hot biscuits cooling, the omelet falling, the tea
drawing too long and all because of her. There was tremendous
etiquette in the Eustace family. Not a cup of tea would Aunt Harriet
pour, not a spoon would Aunt Jane dip into the preserves, not a
butter ball would her grandmother impale upon the little silver fork.
And poor Hannah, the maid, white aproned and capped, would stand
behind Aunt Harriet like a miserable conscious graven image.
Therefore Annie ran, and ran, and it happened that she ran rather
heedlessly and blindly and dropped her mussy little package of fancy
work, and Karl von Rosen, coming out of the parsonage, saw it fall
and picked it up rather gingerly, and called as loudly as was
decorous after the flying figure, but Annie did not hear and Von
Rosen did not want to shout, neither did he want, or rather think it
advisable, to run, therefore he followed holding the linen package
well away from him, as if it were a disagreeable insect. He had never
seen much of Annie Eustace. Now and then he called upon one of her
aunts, who avowed her preference for his religious denomination, but
if he saw Annie at all, she was seated engaged upon some such
doubtfully ornamental or useful task, as the specimen which he now
carried. Truth to say, he had scarcely noticed Annie Eustace at all.
She had produced the effect of shrinking from observation under some
subtle shadow of self-effacement. She was in reality a very rose of a
girl, loving and sweet, and withal wonderfully endowed; but this
human rose, dwelt always for Karl von Rosen, in the densest of bowers
through which her beauty and fragrance of character could not
penetrate his senses. Undoubtedly also, although his masculine
intelligence would have scouted the possibility of such a thing,
Annie's dull, ill-made garb served to isolate her. She also never
came to church. That perfect little face with its expression of
strange insight, must have aroused his attention among his audience.
But there was only the Aunt Harriet Eustace, an exceedingly thin
lady, present and always attired in rich blacks. Karl von Rosen
to-day walking as rapidly as became his dignity, in pursuit of the
young woman, was aware that he hardly felt at liberty to accost her
with anything more than the greeting of the day. He eyed
disapprovingly the parcel which he carried. It was a very dingy
white, and greyish threads dangled from it. Von Rosen thought it a
most unpleasant thing, and reflected with mild scorn and bewilderment
concerning the manner of mind which could find amusement over such
employment, for he divined that it was a specimen of feminine skill,
called fancy work.</p>

<p>Annie Eustace ran so swiftly with those long agile legs of hers
that he soon perceived that interception upon her return, and not
overtaking, must ensue. He did not gain upon her at all, and he began
to understand that he was making himself ridiculous to possible
observers in windows. He therefore slackened his pace, and met Annie
upon her return. She had a letter in her hand and was advancing with
a headlong rush, and suddenly she attracted him. He surrendered the
parcel. &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;but I
almost wish you had not found it.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/bh2.jpg" width="725" height="1198"
alt="[Illustration: &ldquo;I almost wish you had not found
it&rdquo;]">

<p>Von Rosen stared at her. Was she rude after all, this very pretty
girl, who was capable of laughter. &ldquo;You would not blame me if
you had to embroider daisies on that dreadful piece of linen,&rdquo;
said Annie with a rueful glance at the dingy package.</p>

<p>Von Rosen smiled kindly at her. &ldquo;I don't blame you at
all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I can understand it must be a dismal
task to embroider daisies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, Mr. von Rosen&mdash;&rdquo; Annie hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Von Rosen encouragingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I never go to church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Von Rosen mendaciously. He really did not
know. In future he, however, would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't go because&mdash;&rdquo; again Annie
hesitated, while the young man waited interrogatively.</p>

<p>Then Annie spoke with force. &ldquo;I would really like to go
occasionally,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I doubt if I would always care
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't think you would,&rdquo; assented Von Rosen with
a queer delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never can because&mdash;Grandmother is old and she
has not much left in life, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for people to talk about firesides, and
knitting work, and peaceful eyes of age fixed upon Heavenly
homes,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;but all old people are not like
that. Grandma hates to knit although she does think I should
embroider daisies, and she does like to have me play pinocle with her
Sunday mornings, when Aunt Harriet and Aunt Jane are out of the way.
It is the only chance she has during the whole week you know because
neither Aunt Harriet nor Aunt Jane approves of cards, and poor
Grandma is so fond of them, it seems cruel not to play with her the
one chance she has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are entirely right,&rdquo; said Von Rosen with
grave conviction and he was charmed that the girl regarded him as if
he had said nothing whatever unusual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always been sure that it was right,&rdquo; said
Annie Eustace, &ldquo;but I would like sometimes to go to
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really wish you could,&rdquo; said Von Rosen, &ldquo;and
I would make an especial effort to write a good sermon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;Aunt Harriet often hears you
preach one which she thinks very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen bowed. Suddenly Annie's shyness, reserve, whatever it
was, seemed to overcloud her. The lovely red faded from her cheeks,
the light from her eyes. She lost her beauty in a great measure. She
bowed stiffly, saying: &ldquo;I thank you very much, good
evening,&rdquo; and passed on, leaving the young man rather dazed,
pleased and yet distinctly annoyed, and annoyed in some inscrutable
fashion at himself.</p>

<p>Then he heard shouts of childish laughter, and a scamper of
childish feet, and Maida and Adelaide Edes rushed past, almost
jostling him from the sidewalk. Maida carried a letter, which her
mother had written, and dispatched to the last mail. And that letter
was destined to be of more importance to Von Rosen than he knew.</p>

<p>As for Annie Eustace, whose meeting with Von Rosen had, after her
first lapse into the unconsciousness of mirth, disturbed her, as the
meeting of the hero of a dream always disturbs a true maiden who has
not lost through many such meetings the thrill of them, she hurried
home trembling, and found everything just exactly as she knew it
would be.</p>

<p>There sat Aunt Harriet perfectly motionless behind the silver tea
service, and although the cosy was drawn over the teapot, the tea
seemed to be reproachfully drawing to that extent that Annie could
hear it. There sat Aunt Jane behind the cut glass bowl of preserved
fruit, with the untouched silver spoon at hand. There sat her
grandmother behind the butter plate. There stood Hannah, white capped
and white aproned, holding the silver serving tray like a petrified
statue of severity, and not one of them spoke, but their silence,
their dignified, reproachful silence was infinitely worse than a
torrent of invective. How Annie wished they would speak. How she
wished that she could speak herself, but she knew better than to even
offer an excuse for her tardiness. Well she knew that the stony
silence which would meet that would be worse, much worse than this.
So she slid into her place opposite her Aunt Jane, and began her own
task of dividing into sections the omelet which was quite flat
because she was late, and seemed to reproach her in a miserable,
low-down sort of fashion.</p>

<p>However, there was in the girl's heart a little glint of youthful
joy, which was unusual. She had met Mr. Von Rosen and had forgotten
herself, that is at first, and he had looked kindly at her. There was
no foolish hope in little Annie Eustace's heart; there would be no
spire of aspiration added to her dreams because of the meeting, but
she tasted the sweet of approbation, and it was a tonic which she
sorely needed, and which inspired her to self-assertion in a
childishly naughty and mischievous way. It was after supper that
evening, that Annie strolled a little way down the street, taking
advantage of Miss Bessy Dicky's dropping in for a call, to slink
unobserved out of her shadowy corner, for the Eustaces were fond of
sitting in the twilight. The wind had come up, the violent strong
wind which comes out of the south, and Annie walked very near the
barberry hedge which surrounded Doctor Sturtevant's grounds, and the
green muslin lashed against it to its undoing. When Annie returned,
the skirt was devastated and Aunt Harriet decreed that it could not
be mended and must be given to the poor Joy children. There were many
of those children of a degenerate race, living on the outskirts of
Fairbridge, and Annie had come to regard them as living effigies of
herself, since everything which she had outgrown or injured past
repair, fell to them. &ldquo;There will be enough to make two nice
dresses for Charlotte and Minnie Joy,&rdquo; said Aunt Harriet,
&ldquo;and it will not be wasted, even if you have been so careless,
Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie could see a vision of those two little Joy girls getting
about in the remnants of her ghastly muslin, and she shuddered,
although with relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better wear your cross barred white muslin
afternoons now,&rdquo; said Aunt Harriet, and Annie smiled for that
was a pretty dress. She smiled still more when Aunt Jane said that
now as the cross-barred white was to be worn every day, another dress
must be bought, and she mentioned China silk&mdash;something which
Annie had always longed to own&mdash;and blue, dull blue,&mdash;a
colour which she loved.</p>

<p>Just before she went to bed, Annie stood in the front doorway
looking out at the lovely moonlight and the wonderful shadows which
transformed the village street, like the wings of angels, and she
heard voices and laughter from the Edes' house opposite. Then
Margaret began singing in her shrill piercing voice from which she
had hoped much, but which had failed to please, even at the Zenith
Club.</p>

<p>Annie adored Margaret, but she shrank before her singing voice. If
she had only known what was passing through the mind of the singer
after she went to bed that night, she would have shuddered more, for
Margaret Edes was planning a possible <i>coup</i> before which Annie,
in spite of a little latent daring of her own, would have been
aghast.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter V</h4>

<p>The next morning Margaret announced herself as feeling so much
better that she thought she would go to New York. She had several
errands, she said, and the day was beautiful and the little change
would do her good. She would take the train with her husband, but a
different ferry, as she wished to go up town. Wilbur acquiesced
readily. &ldquo;It is a mighty fine morning, and you need to get
out,&rdquo; he said. Poor Wilbur at this time felt guiltily culpable
that he did not own a motor car in which his Margaret might take the
air. He had tried to see his way clear toward buying one, but in
spite of a certain improvidence, the whole nature of the man was
intrinsically honest. He always ended his conference with himself
concerning the motor by saying that he could not possibly keep it
running, even if he were to manage the first cost, and pay regularly
his other bills. He, however, felt it to be a shame to himself that
it was so, and experienced a thrill of positive pain of covetousness,
not for himself, but for his Margaret, when one of the luxurious
things whirled past him in Fairbridge. He, it was true, kept a very
smart little carriage and horse, but that was not as much as Margaret
should have. Every time Margaret seemed a little dull, or complained
of headache, as she had done lately, he thought miserably of that
motor car, which was her right. Therefore when she planned any little
trip like that of to-day, he was immeasurably pleased. At the same
time he regarded her with a slightly bewildered expression, for in
some subtle fashion, her face as she propounded the trifling plan,
looked odd to him, and her voice also did not sound quite natural.
However, he dismissed the idea at once as mere fancy, and watched
proudly the admiring glances bestowed upon her in the Fairbridge
station, while they were waiting for the train. Margaret had a
peculiar knack in designing costumes which were at once plain and
striking. This morning she wore a black China silk, through the thin
bodice of which was visible an under silk strewn with gold disks. Her
girdle was clasped with a gold buckle, and when she moved there were
slight glimpses of a yellow silk petticoat. Her hat was black, but
under the brim was tucked a yellow rose against her yellow hair. Then
to finish all, Margaret wore in the lace at her throat, a great
brooch of turquoise matrix, which matched her eyes. Her husband
realised her as perfectly attired, although he did not in the least
understand why. He knew that his Margaret looked a woman of another
race from the others in the station, in their tailored skirts, and
shirtwaists, with their coats over arm, and their shopping bags
firmly clutched. It was a warm morning, and feminine Fairbridge's
idea of a suitable costume for a New York shopping trip was a
tailored suit, and a shirtwaist, and as a rule, the shirtwaist did
not fit. Margaret never wore shirtwaists,&mdash;she understood that
she was too short unless she combined a white skirt with a waist.
Margaret would have broken a commandment with less hesitation than
she would have broken the line of her graceful little figure with two
violently contrasting colours. Mrs. Sturtevant in a grey skirt and an
elaborate white waist, which emphasised her large bust, looked
ridiculous beside this fair, elegant little Margaret, although her
clothes had in reality cost more. Wilbur watched his wife as she
talked sweetly with the other woman, and his heart swelled with the
pride of possession. When they were on the train and he sat by
himself in the smoker, having left Margaret with Mrs. Sturtevant, his
heart continued to feel warm with elation. He waited to assist his
wife off the train at Jersey City and realised it a trial that he
could not cross the river on the same ferry. Margaret despised the
tube and he wished for the short breath of sea air which he would get
on the Courtland ferry. He glanced after her retreating black skirts
with the glimpses of yellow, regretfully, before he turned his back
and turned toward his own slip. And he glanced the more regretfully
because this morning, with all his admiration of his wife, he had a
dim sense of something puzzling which arose like a cloud of mystery
between them.</p>

<p>Wilbur Edes sailing across the river had, however, no conception
of the change which had begun in his little world. It was only a
shake of the kaleidoscope of an unimportant life, resulting in a
different combination of atoms, but to each individual it would be a
tremendous event partaking of the nature of a cataclysm. That morning
he had seen upon Margaret's charming face an expression which made it
seem as the face of a stranger. He tried to dismiss the matter from
his mind. He told himself that it must have been the effect of the
light or that she had pinned on her hat at a different angle. Women
are so perplexing, and their attire alters them so strangely. But
Wilbur Edes had reason to be puzzled. Margaret had looked and really
was different. In a little while she had become practically a
different woman. Of course, she had only developed possibilities
which had always been dormant within her, but they had been so
dormant, that they had not been to any mortal perception endowed with
life. Hitherto Margaret had walked along the straight and narrow way,
sometimes, it is true, jostling circumstances and sometimes being
jostled by them, yet keeping to the path. Now she had turned her feet
into that broad way wherein there is room for the utmost self which
is in us all. Henceforth husband and wife would walk apart in a
spiritual sense, unless there should come a revolution in the
character of the wife, who was the stepper aside.</p>

<p>Margaret seated comfortably on the ferry boat, her little feet
crossed so discreetly that only a glimpse of the yellow fluff beneath
was visible, was conscious of a not unpleasurable exhilaration. She
might and she might not be about to do something which would place
her distinctly outside the pale which had henceforth enclosed her
little pleasance of life. Were she to cross that pale, she felt that
it might be distinctly amusing. Margaret was not a wicked woman, but
virtue, not virtue in the ordinary sense of the word, but straight
walking ahead according to the ideas of Fairbridge, had come to drive
her at times to the verge of madness. Then, too, there was always
that secret terrible self-love and ambition of hers, never satisfied,
always defeated by petty weapons. Margaret, sitting as gracefully as
a beautiful cat, on the ferry boat that morning realised the
vindictive working of her claws, and her impulse to strike at her
odds of life, and she derived therefrom an unholy exhilaration.</p>

<p>She got her taxicab on the other side and leaned back, catching
frequent glances of admiration, and rode pleasurably to the regal
up-town hotel which was the home of Miss Martha Wallingford, while in
the city. She, upon her arrival, entered the hotel with an air which
caused a stir among bell boys. Then she entered a reception room and
sat down, disposing herself with slow grace. Margaret gazed about her
and waited. There were only three people in the room, one man and two
ladies, one quite young&mdash;a mere girl&mdash;the other from the
resemblance and superior age, evidently her mother. The man was young
and almost vulgarly well-groomed. He had given a glance at Margaret
as she entered, a glance of admiration tempered with the
consideration that in spite of her grace and beauty, she was probably
older than himself. Then he continued to gaze furtively at the young
girl who sat demurely, with eyes downcast beneath a soft, wild tangle
of dark hair, against which some pink roses and a blue feather on her
hat showed fetchingly. She was very well dressed, evidently a
well-guarded young thing from one of the summer colonies. The mother,
high corseted, and elegant in dark blue lines, which made only a
graceful concession to age, without fairly admitting it, never
allowed one glance of the young man's to escape her. She also saw her
slender young daughter with every sense in her body and mind.</p>

<p>Margaret looked away from them. The elder woman had given her
costume an appreciative, and herself a supercilious glance, which had
been met with one which did not seem to recognise her visibility.
Margaret was not easily put down by another woman. She stared
absently at the ornate and weary decorations of the room. It was
handsome, but tiresome, as everybody who entered realised, and as, no
doubt, the decorator had found out. It was a ready-made species of
room, with no heart in it, in spite of the harmonious colour scheme
and really artistic detail.</p>

<p>Presently the boy with the silver tray entered and approached
Margaret. The young man stared openly at her. He began to wonder if
she were not younger than he had thought. The girl never raised her
downcast eyes; the older woman cast one swift sharp glance at her.
The boy murmured so inaudibly that Margaret barely heard, and she
rose and followed him as he led the way to the elevator. Miss
Wallingford, who was a young Western woman and a rising, if not
already arisen literary star, had signified her willingness to
receive Mrs. Wilbur Edes in her own private sitting-room. Margaret
was successful so far. She had pencilled on her card, &ldquo;Can you
see me on a matter of importance? I am not connected with the
Press,&rdquo; and the young woman who esteemed nearly everything of
importance, and was afraid of the Press, had agreed at once to see
her. Miss Martha Wallingford was staying in the hotel with an elderly
aunt, against whose rule she rebelled in spite of her youth and
shyness, which apparently made it impossible for her to rebel against
anybody, and the aunt had retired stiffly to her bedroom when her
niece said positively that she would see her caller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know who she is and I promised your Pa when we
started that I wouldn't let you get acquainted with folks unless I
knew all about them,&rdquo; the aunt had said and the niece, the
risen star, had set her mouth hard. &ldquo;We haven't seen a soul
except those newspaper men, and I know everyone of them is married,
and those two newspaper women who told about my sleeves being out of
date,&rdquo; said Martha Wallingford, &ldquo;and this Mrs. Edes may
be real nice. I'm going to see her anyhow. We came so late in the
season that I believe everybody in New York worth seeing has gone
away and this lady has come in from the country and it may lead to my
having a good time after all. I haven't had much of a time so far,
and you know it, Aunt Susan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you talk, Martha Wallingford! Haven't you been to the
theatre every night and Coney Island, and the Metropolitan
and&mdash;everything there is to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn't much to see in New York anyway except the
people,&rdquo; returned the niece. &ldquo;People are all I care for
anyway, and I don't call the people I have seen worth counting. They
only came to make a little money out of me and my sleeves. I am glad
I got this dress at McCreery's. These sleeves are all right. If this
Mrs. Edes should be a newspaper woman, she can't make fun of these
sleeves anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You paid an awful price for that dress,&rdquo; said her
aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care. I got such a lot for my book that I might as
well have a little out of it, and you know as well as I do, Aunt
Susan, that South Mordan, Illinois, may be a very nice place, but it
does not keep up with New York fashions. I really did not have a
decent thing to wear when I started. Miss Slocumb did as well as she
knew how, but her ideas are about three years behind New York. I
didn't know myself, how should I? And you didn't, and as for Pa, he
would think everything I had on was stylish if it dated back to the
ark. You ought to have bought that mauve silk for yourself. You have
money enough; you know you have, Aunt Susan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have money enough, thanks to my dear husband's saving all
his life, but it is not going to be squandered on dress by me, now he
is dead and gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have bought the dress for you myself, then,&rdquo;
said the niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; returned the aunt with asperity.
&ldquo;I have never been in the habit of being beholden to you for my
clothes and I am not going to begin now. I didn't want that dress
anyway. I always hated purple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn't purple, it was mauve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call purple, purple, I don't call it anything
else!&rdquo;  Then the aunt retreated precipitately before the sound
of the opening door and entrenched herself in her bedroom, where she
stood listening.</p>

<p>Margaret Edes treated the young author with the respect which she
really deserved, for talent she possessed in such a marked degree as
to make her phenomenal, and the phenomenal is always entitled to
consideration of some sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Wallingford?&rdquo; murmured Margaret, and she gave an
impression of obeisance; this charming elegantly attired lady before
the Western girl. Martha Wallingford coloured high with delight and
admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Miss Wallingford,&rdquo; she replied and asked
her caller to be seated. Margaret sat down facing her. The young
author shuffled in her chair like a school girl. She was an odd
combination of enormous egotism and the most painful shyness. She
realised at a glance that she herself was provincial and pitifully at
a disadvantage personally before this elegant vision, and her
personality was in reality more precious to her than her talent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not tell you what a great pleasure and privilege this
is for me,&rdquo; said Margaret, and her blue eyes had an expression
of admiring rapture. The girl upon whom the eyes were fixed, blushed
and giggled and tossed her head with a sudden show of pride. She
quite agreed that it was a pleasure and privilege for Margaret to see
her, the author of <i>Hearts Astray</i>, even if Margaret was herself
so charming and so provokingly well dressed. Miss Martha Wallingford
did not hide her light of talent under a bushel with all her shyness,
which was not really shyness at all but a species of rather sullen
pride and resentment because she was so well aware that she could not
do well the things which were asked of her and had not mastered the
art of dress and self poise.</p>

<p>Therefore, Martha, with the delight of her own achievements full
upon her face, which was pretty, although untutored, regarded her
visitor with an expression which almost made Margaret falter. It was
probably the absurd dressing of the girl's hair which restored
Margaret's confidence in her scheme. Martha Wallingford actually wore
a frizzled bang, very finely frizzled too, and her hair was strained
from the nape of her neck, and it seemed impossible that a young
woman who knew no better than to arrange her hair in such fashion,
should not be amenable to Margaret's plan. The plan, moreover,
sounded very simple, except for the little complications which might
easily arise. Margaret smiled into the pretty face under the fuzz of
short hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Wallingford,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have
come this morning to beg a favour. I hope you will not refuse me,
although I am such an entire stranger. If, unfortunately, my intimate
friend, Mrs. Fay-Wyman, of whom I assume that you of course know,
even if you have not met her, as you may easily have done, or her
daughter, Miss Edith Fay-Wyman, had not left town last week for their
country house, Rose-In-Flower, at Hyphen-by-the-Sea, a most
delightful spot. Mr. Edes and I have spent several week ends there. I
am prevented from spending longer than week ends because I am kept at
home by my two darling twin daughters. Mrs. Fay-Wyman is a sweet
woman and I do so wish I could have brought her here to-day. I am
sure you would at once fall madly in love with her and also with her
daughter, Miss Edith Fay-Wyman, such a sweet girl, and&mdash;&rdquo;
But here Margaret was unexpectedly, even rudely interrupted by Miss
Wallingford, who looked at her indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never fall in love with women,&rdquo; stated that newly
risen literary star abruptly, &ldquo;why should I? What does it
amount to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; cried Margaret, &ldquo;when you are a
little older you will find that it amounts to very much. There is a
soul sympathy, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think that I care much about soul sympathy,&rdquo;
stated Miss Wallingford, who was beginning to be angrily bewildered
by her guest's long sentences, which so far seemed to have no point
as far as she herself was concerned.</p>

<p>Margaret started a little. Again the doubt seized her if she were
not making a mistake, undertaking more than she could well carry
through, for this shy authoress was fast developing unexpected
traits. However, Margaret, once she had started, was not easily
turned back. She was as persistently clinging as a sweet briar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was like
trickling honey, &ldquo;only wait until you are a little older and
you will find that you do care, care very, very much. The
understanding and sympathy of other women will become very sweet to
you. It is so pure and ennobling, so free from all material
taint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen a great many women who were perfect
cats,&rdquo; stated Miss Martha Wallingford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you are older,&rdquo; said Margaret again and
her voice seemed fairly dissolving into some spiritual liquid of
divine sweetness. &ldquo;Wait until you are older, my dear. You are
very young, so young to have accomplished a wonderful work which will
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Martha Wallingford, and as she spoke
she fixed pitiless shrewd young eyes upon the face of the other
woman, which did not show at its best, in spite of veil and the
velvety darkness of hat-shadow. This hotel sitting-room was full of
garish cross lights. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Martha Wallingford,
&ldquo;of course, I don't know what may happen if I live to be old,
as old as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret Edes felt like a photograph proof before the slightest
attempt at finish had been made. Those keen young eyes conveyed the
impression of convex mirrors. She restrained an instinctive impulse
to put a hand before her face, she had an odd helpless sensation
before the almost brutal, clear-visioned young thing. Again she
shrank a little from her task, again her spirit reasserted itself.
She moved and brought her face somewhat more into the shadow. Then
she spoke again. She wisely dropped the subject of feminine
affinities. She plunged at once into the object of her visit, which
directly concerned Miss Martha Wallingford, and Margaret, who was as
astute in her way as the girl, knew that she was entirely right in
assuming that Martha Wallingford was more interested in herself than
anything else in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I may as well tell you at
once why I intruded upon you this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Martha Wallingford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I said before, I deeply regret that I was unable to
bring some well-known person, Mrs. Fay-Wyman, for instance, to make
us acquainted in due form, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't care a bit about that,&rdquo; said Martha.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret again started a little. She had not expected anything
like this. The mental picture which she had formed of Martha
Wallingford, the young literary star, seemed to undergo a
transformation akin to an explosion, out of which only one feature
remained intact&mdash;the book, &ldquo;<i>Hearts Astray</i>.&rdquo;
If Miss Wallingford had not possessed a firm foundation in that
volume, it is entirely possible that Margaret might have abandoned
her enterprise. As it was, after a little gasp she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did so wish to assure you in person of my great
admiration for your wonderful book,&rdquo; said she. Martha
Wallingford made no reply. She had an expression of utter
acquiescence in the admiration, also of having heard that same thing
so many times, that she was somewhat bored by it. She waited with
questioning eyes upon Margaret's face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wondered,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;if you would
consider it too informal, if I ventured to beg you to be my guest at
my home in Fairbridge next Thursday and remain the weekend, over
Sunday. It would give me so much pleasure, and Fairbridge is a
charming little village and there are really many interesting people
there whom I think you would enjoy, and as for them&mdash;!&rdquo;
Margaret gave a slight roll to her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;they would be
simply overwhelmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to come very much, thank you,&rdquo; said
Martha Wallingford.</p>

<p>Margaret beamed. &ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I
can not tell you how much joy your prompt and warm response gives me.
And&mdash;&rdquo; Margaret looked about her rather vaguely,
&ldquo;you are not alone here, of course. You have a maid, or
perhaps, your mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Aunt Susan is with me,&rdquo; said Miss Wallingford,
&ldquo;but there is no use inviting her. She hates going away for a
few days. She says it is just as much trouble packing as it would be
to go for a month. There is no use even thinking of her, but I shall
be delighted to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated. &ldquo;May I not have the pleasure of being
presented to your aunt?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Susan is out shopping,&rdquo; lied Miss Martha
Wallingford. Aunt Susan was clad in a cotton crepe wrapper, and
Martha knew that she would think it quite good enough for her to
receive anybody in, and that she could not convince her to the
contrary. It was only recently that Martha herself had become
converted from morning wrappers, and the reaction was violent.
&ldquo;The idea of a woman like this Mrs. Edes seeing Aunt Susan in
that awful pink crepe wrapper!&rdquo; she said to herself. She hoped
Aunt Susan was not listening, and would not make a forcible entry
into the room. Aunt Susan in moments of impulse was quite capable of
such coups. Martha glanced rather apprehensively toward the door
leading into the bedroom but it did not open. Aunt Susan was indeed
listening and she was rigid with indignation, but in truth, she did
not want to accompany her niece upon this projected visit, and she
was afraid of being drawn into such a step should she present
herself. Aunt Susan did dislike making the effort of a visit for a
few days only. Martha had told the truth. It was very hot, and the
elder woman was not very strong. Moreover, she perceived that Martha
did not want her and there would be the complication of kicking
against the pricks of a very determined character, which had grown
more determined since her literary success. In fact, Aunt Susan stood
in a slight awe of her niece since that success, for all her revolts
which were superficial. Therefore, she remained upon her side of the
door which she did not open until the visitor had departed after
making definite arrangements concerning trains and meetings. Then
Aunt Susan entered the room with a cloud of pink crepe in her
wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; she demanded of Martha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wilbur Edes,&rdquo; replied her niece, and she aped
Margaret to perfection as she added, &ldquo;and a most charming
woman, most charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she want you to do?&rdquo; inquired the aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Aunt Susan,&rdquo; replied the niece, &ldquo;what is
the use of going over it all? You heard every single thing she
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did hear her ask after me,&rdquo; said the aunt
unabashed, &ldquo;and I heard you tell a lie about it. You told her I
had gone out shopping and you knew I was right in the next
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean to have you come in and see a woman dressed
like that one, in your wrapper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with my wrapper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; asked her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what your Pa would say,&rdquo; remarked Aunt
Susan, but rather feebly, for she had a vague idea that it was her
duty to accompany her niece and she was determined to shirk it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how Pa can say much of anything since he is in
South Mordan, Illinois, and won't know about it, unless you
telegraph, until next week,&rdquo; said Martha calmly. &ldquo;Now,
come along, Aunt Susan, and get dressed. I have made up my mind to
get that beautiful white silk dress we looked at yesterday. It did
not need any alteration and I think I shall buy that pearl and
amethyst necklace at Tiffany's. I know Mrs. Edes will have an evening
party and there will be gentlemen, and what is the use of my making
so much money out of <i>Hearts Astray</i> if I don't have a few
things I want? Hurry and get dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why this wrapper isn't plenty good enough for a
few errands at two or three stores,&rdquo; said the aunt sulkily, but
she yielded to Martha's imperative demand that she change her wrapper
for her black satin immediately.</p>

<p>Meantime Margaret on her way down town to the ferry was conscious
of a slight consternation at what she had done. She understood that
in this young woman was a feminine element which radically differed
from any which had come within her ken. She, however, was determined
to go on. The next day invitations were issued to the Zenith Club for
the following Friday, from four to six, and also one to dinner that
evening to four men and five women. She planned for Sunday an
automobile ride; she was to hire the car from the Axminister garage,
and a high tea afterward. Poor Margaret did all in her power to make
her scheme a success, but always she had that chilling doubt of her
power. Miss Martha Wallingford had impressed her as being a young
woman capable of swift and unexpected movements. She was rather
afraid of her but she did not confess her fear to Wilbur. When he
inquired genially what kind of a girl the authoress was, she replied:
&ldquo;Oh, charming, of course, but the poor child does not know how
to do up her hair.&rdquo;  However, when Martha arrived Thursday
afternoon and Margaret met her at the station, she, at a glance,
discovered that the poor child had discovered how to do up her hair.
Some persons' brains work in a great many directions and Martha
Wallingford's was one of them. Somehow or other, she had contrived to
dispose of her tightly frizzed fringe, and her very pretty hair swept
upward from a forehead which was both intellectual and beautiful. She
was well dressed too. She had drawn heavily upon her royalty revenue.
She had worked hard and spent a good deal during the short time since
Margaret's call, and her brain had served her body well. She stepped
across the station platform with an air. She carried no provincial
bag&mdash;merely a dainty little affair mounted in gold which matched
her gown&mdash;and she had brought a small steamer trunk.</p>

<p>Margaret's heart sank more and more, but she conducted her visitor
to her little carriage and ordered the man to drive home, and when
arrived there, showed Martha her room. She had a faint hope that the
room might intimidate this Western girl, but instead of intimidation
there was exultation. She looked about her very coolly, but
afterward, upon her return to East Mordan, Illinois, she bragged a
good deal about it. The room was really very charming and rather
costly. The furniture was genuine First Empire; the walls, which were
hung with paper covered with garlands of roses, were decorated with
old engravings; there was a quantity of Dresden ware and there was a
little tiled bathroom. Over a couch in the bedroom lay a kimona of
white silk embroidered with pink roses. Afterward Martha made cruel
fun of her Aunt's pink crepe and made her buy a kimona.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I send up my maid to assist you in unpacking, Miss
Wallingford?&rdquo; inquired Margaret, inwardly wondering how the
dinner would be managed if the offer were accepted. To her relief,
Martha gave her an offended stare. &ldquo;No, thank you, Mrs.
Edes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I never like servants, especially other
peoples', mussing up my things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Margaret had gone, Martha looked about her, and her mouth was
frankly wide open. She had never seen such exquisite daintiness and
it daunted her, although she would have died rather than admit it.
She thought of her own bedroom at home in East Mordan, Illinois, with
its old black walnut chamber set and framed photographs and chromos,
but she maintained a sort of defiant pride in it even to herself. In
Martha Wallingford's character there was an element partaking of the
nature of whalebone, yielding, but practically unbreakable, and
sometimes wholly unyielding. Martha proceeded to array herself for
dinner. She had not a doubt that it would be a grand affair. She
therefore did not hesitate about the white silk, which was a robe of
such splendour that it might not have disgraced a court. It showed a
great deal of her thin, yet pretty girlish neck, and it had a very
long train. She had a gold fillet studded with diamonds for her
hair&mdash;that hair which was now dressed according to the very
latest mode&mdash;a mode which was startling, yet becoming, and she
clasped around her throat the Tiffany necklace, and as a crowning
touch, put on long white gloves. When she appeared upon the verandah
where Margaret sat dressed in a pretty lingerie gown with Wilbur in a
light grey business suit, the silence could be heard. Then there was
one double gasp of admiration from Maida and Adelaide in their white
frocks and blue ribbons. They looked at the visitor with positive
adoration, but she flushed hotly. She was a very quick-witted girl.
Margaret recovered herself, presented Wilbur, and shortly, they went
in to dinner, but it was a ghastly meal. Martha Wallingford in her
unsuitable splendour was frankly, as she put it afterward,
&ldquo;hopping mad,&rdquo; and Wilbur was unhappy and Margaret
aghast, although apparently quite cool. There was not a guest besides
Martha. The dinner was simple. Afterward it seemed too farcical to
ask a guest attired like a young princess to go out on the verandah
and lounge in a wicker chair, while Wilbur smoked. Then Annie Eustace
appeared and Margaret was grateful. &ldquo;Dear Annie,&rdquo; she
said, after she had introduced the two girls, &ldquo;I am so glad you
came over. Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pleasanter on the verandah, isn't it?&rdquo; began
Annie, then she caught Margaret's expressive glance at the
magnificent white silk. They all sat stiffly in Margaret's pretty
drawing-room. Martha said she didn't play bridge and upon Annie's
timid suggestion of pinocle, said she had never heard of it. Wilbur
dared not smoke. All that wretched evening they sat there. The
situation was too much for Margaret, that past mistress of
situations, and her husband was conscious of a sensation approaching
terror and also wrath whenever he glanced at the figure in sumptuous
white, the figure expressing sulkiness in every feature and motion.
Margaret was unmistakably sulky as the evening wore on and nobody
came except this other girl of whom she took no notice at all. She
saw that she was pretty, her hair badly arranged and she was
ill-dressed, and that was enough for her. She felt it to be an insult
that these people had invited her and asked nobody to meet her,
Martha Wallingford, whose name was in all the papers, attired in this
wonderful white gown. When Annie Eustace arose to go, she arose too
with a peremptory motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess I will go to bed,&rdquo; said Martha
Wallingford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be weary,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not tired,&rdquo; said Martha Wallingford, &ldquo;but
it seems to me as dull here as in South Mordan, Illinois. I might as
well go to bed and to sleep as sit here any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Margaret had returned from the guest room, her husband looked
at her almost in a bewildered fashion. Margaret sank wearily into a
chair. &ldquo;Isn't she impossible?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she think there was a dinner party?&rdquo; Wilbur
inquired perplexedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. It was ghastly. I did not for a moment
suppose she would dress for a party, unless I told her, and it is
Emma's night off and I could not ask people with only Clara to cook
and wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilbur patted his wife's shoulder comfortingly. &ldquo;Never mind,
dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when she gets her chance to do her
to-morrow's stunt at your club, she will be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret shivered a little. She had dared say nothing to Martha
about that &ldquo;stunt.&rdquo;  Was it possible that she was making
a horrible mistake?</p>

<p>The next day, Martha was still sulky but she did not, as Margaret
feared, announce her intention of returning at once to New York.
Margaret said quite casually that she had invited a few of the
brightest and most interesting people in Fairbridge to meet her that
afternoon and Martha became curious, although still resentful, and
made no motion to leave. She, however, resolved to make no further
mistakes as to costume, and just as the first tide of the Zenith Club
broke over Margaret's threshold, she appeared clad in one of her
South Mordan, Illinois, gowns. It was one which she had tucked into
her trunk in view of foul weather. It was a hideous thing made from
two old gowns. It had a garish blue tunic reaching well below the
hips and a black skirt bordered with blue. Martha had had it made
herself from a pattern after long study of the fashion plates in a
Sunday newspaper and the result, although startling, still half
convinced her. It was only after she had seen all the members of the
Zenith Club seated and had gazed at their costumes, that she realised
that she had made a worse mistake than that of the night before. To
begin with, the day was very warm and her gown heavy and clumsy. The
other ladies were arrayed in lovely lingeries or light silks and
laces. The Zenith Club was exceedingly well dressed on that day.
Martha sat in her place beside her hostess and her face looked like a
sulky child's. Her eye-lids were swollen, her pouting lips dropped at
the corners. She stiffened her chin until it became double. Margaret
was inwardly perturbed but she concealed it. The programme went on
with the inevitable singing by Miss MacDonald and Mrs. Wells, the
playing by Mrs. Jack Evarts, the recitation by Sally Anderson.
Margaret had not ventured to omit those features. Then, Mrs.
Sturtevant read in a trembling voice a paper on Emerson. Then
Margaret sprang her mines. She rose and surveyed her audience with
smiling impressiveness. &ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; she said, and there was
an immediate hush, &ldquo;Ladies, I have the pleasure, the exceeding
pleasure of presenting you to my guest, Miss Martha Wallingford, the
author of <i>Hearts Astray</i>. She will now speak briefly to you
upon her motive in writing and her method of work.&rdquo;  There was
a soft clapping of hands. Margaret sat down. She was quite pale.
Annie Eustace regarded her wonderingly. What had happened to her dear
Margaret?</p>

<p>The people waited. Everybody stared at Miss Martha Wallingford who
had written that great seller, <i>Hearts Astray</i>. Martha
Wallingford sat perfectly still. Her eyes were so downcast that they
gave the appearance of being closed. Her pretty face looked red and
swollen. Everybody waited. She sat absolutely still and made no sign
except that of her obstinate face of negation. Margaret bent over her
and whispered. Martha did not even do her the grace of a shake of the
head.</p>

<p>Everybody waited again. Martha Wallingford sat so still that she
gave the impression of a doll made without speaking apparatus. It did
not seem as if she could even wink. Then Alice Mendon, who disliked
Margaret Edes and had a shrewd conjecture as to the state of affairs,
but who was broad in her views, pitied Margaret. She arose with
considerable motion and spoke to Daisy Shaw at her right, and broke
the ghastly silence, and immediately everything was in motion and
refreshments were being passed, but Martha Wallingford, who had
written <i>Hearts Astray</i>, was not there to partake of them. She
was in her room, huddled in a chair upholstered with cream silk
strewn with roses; and she was in one of the paroxysms of silent rage
which belonged to her really strong, although undisciplined nature,
and which was certainly in this case justified to some degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an outrage,&rdquo; she said to herself. She saw
through it all now. She had refused to speak or to read before all
those women's clubs and now this woman had trapped her, that was the
word for it, trapped her.</p>

<p>As she sat there, her sullenly staring angry eyes saw in large
letters at the head of a column in a morning paper on the table
beside her, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>The Poor Lady</i>,&rsquo; the greatest
anonymous novel of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she fell again to thinking of her wrongs and planning how she
should wreak vengeance upon Margaret Edes.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VI</h4>

<p>Martha Wallingford was a young person of direct methods. She
scorned subterfuges. Another of her age and sex might have gone to
bed with a headache, not she. She sat absolutely still beside her
window, quite in full view of the departing members of the Zenith
Club, had they taken the trouble to glance in that direction, and
some undoubtedly did, and she remained there; presently she heard her
hostess's tiny rap on the door. Martha did not answer, but after a
repeated rap and wait, Margaret chose to assume that she did, and
entered. Margaret knelt in a soft flop of scented lingerie beside the
indignant young thing. She explained, she apologised, she begged, she
implored Martha to put on that simply ravishing gown which she had
worn the evening before; she expatiated at length upon the charms of
the people whom she had invited to dinner, but Martha spoke not at
all until she was quite ready. Then she said explosively, &ldquo;I
won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent after that. Margaret recognised the futility of
further entreaties. She went down stairs and confided in Wilbur.
&ldquo;I never saw such an utterly impossible girl,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;there she sits and won't get dressed and come down to
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a freak, must be, most of these writer people are
freaks,&rdquo; said Wilbur sympathetically. &ldquo;Poor old girl, and
I suppose you have got up a nice dinner too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A perfectly charming dinner and invited people to meet
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did she do her stunt this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret flushed. &ldquo;None too well,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, dear, I don't see how you are to
blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can say that Miss Wallingford is not well, I
suppose,&rdquo; said Margaret, and that was what she did say, but
with disastrous results.</p>

<p>Margaret, ravishing in white lace, sprinkled with little gold
butterflies, had taken her place at the head of her table. Emma was
serving the first course and she was making her little speech
concerning the unfortunate indisposition of her guest of honour when
she was suddenly interrupted by that guest herself, an image of sulky
wrath, clad in the blue and black costume pertaining to South Mordan,
Illinois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly well. She is telling an awful
whopper,&rdquo; proclaimed this amazing girl. &ldquo;I won't dress up
and come to dinner because I won't. She trapped me into a woman's
club this afternoon and tried to get me to make a speech without even
telling me what she meant to do and now I won't do
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that Miss Wallingford disappeared and unmistakable stamps
were heard upon the stairs. One woman giggled convulsively; another
took a glass of water and choked. A man laughed honestly. Wilbur was
quite pale. Margaret was imperturbable. Karl von Rosen, who was one
of the guests and who sat behind Annie Eustace, looked at Margaret
with wonder. &ldquo;Was this the way of women?&rdquo; he thought. He
did not doubt for one minute that the Western girl had spoken the
truth. It had been brutal and homely, but it had been the truth.
Little Annie Eustace, who had been allowed to come to a dinner party
for the first time in her life and who looked quite charming in an
old, much mended, but very fine India muslin and her grandmother's
corals, did not, on the contrary, believe one word of Miss
Wallingford's.</p>

<p>Her sympathy was all with her Margaret. It was a horrible
situation and her dear Margaret was the victim of her own
hospitality. She looked across the table at Alice Mendon for another
sympathiser, but Alice was talking busily to the man at her right
about a new book. She had apparently not paid much attention. Annie
wondered how it could have escaped her. That horrid girl had spoken
so loudly. She looked up at Von Rosen. &ldquo;I am so sorry for poor
Margaret,&rdquo; she whispered. Von Rosen looked down at her very
gently. This little girl's belief in her friend was like a sacred
lily, not to be touched or soiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said and Annie smiled up at him comfortably.
Von Rosen was glad she sat beside him. He thought her very lovely,
and there was a subtle suggestion of something besides loveliness. He
thought that daintily mended India muslin exquisite, and also the
carved corals,&mdash;bracelets on the slender wrists, a
necklace&mdash;resting like a spray of flowers on the girlish neck, a
comb in the soft hair which Annie had arranged becomingly and covered
from her aunt's sight with a lace scarf. She felt deceitful about her
hair, but how could she help it?</p>

<p>The dinner was less ghastly than could have been expected after
the revelation of the guest of honour and the blank consternation of
the host, who made no attempt to conceal his state of mind. Poor
Wilbur had no society tricks. Alice Mendon, who was quite cognizant
of the whole matter, but was broad enough to leap to the aid of
another woman, did much. She had quite a talent for witty stories and
a goodly fund of them. The dinner went off very well, while Martha
Wallingford ate hers from a dinner tray in her room and felt that
every morsel was sweetened with righteous revenge.</p>

<p>The next morning she left for New York and Margaret did not
attempt to detain her although she had a lunch party planned besides
the Sunday festivities. Margaret had had a scene with Wilbur after
the departure of the guests the previous evening. For the first time
in her experience, the devoted husband had turned upon his goddess.
He had asked, &ldquo;Was it true, what that girl said?&rdquo; and
Margaret had laughed up at him bewitchingly to no effect. Wilbur's
face was very stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;I knew perfectly well
that if I actually asked her to speak or read, she would have
refused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done an unpardonable thing,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;You have betrayed your own sense of honour, your hospitality
toward the guest under your roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret laughed as she took an ornament from her yellow head but
the laugh was defiant and forced. In her heart she bitterly resented
her husband's attitude and more bitterly resented the attitude of
respect into which it forced her. &ldquo;It is the very last time I
ask a Western authoress to accept my hospitality,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Wilbur gravely.</p>

<p>That night Karl von Rosen walked home with Annie Eustace. She had
come quite unattended, as was the wont of Fairbridge ladies. That
long peaceful Main Street lined with the homes of good people always
seemed a safe thoroughfare. Annie was even a little surprised when
Von Rosen presented himself and said, &ldquo;I will walk home with
you, Miss Eustace, with your permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I live a quarter of a mile past your house,&rdquo; said
Annie.</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed. &ldquo;A quarter of a mile will not injure
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will really be a half mile,&rdquo; said Annie. She
wanted very much that the young man should walk home with her, but
she was very much afraid of making trouble. She was relieved when he
only laughed again and said something about the beauty of the night.
It was really a wonderful night and even the eyes of youth,
inhabiting it with fairy dreams, were not essential to perceive
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What flower scent is that?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Annie, &ldquo;that it is wild
honeysuckle,&rdquo; and her voice trembled slightly. The perfumed
night and the strange presence beside her went to the child's head a
bit. The two walked along under the trees, which cast etching-like
shadows in the broad moonlight, and neither talked much. There was
scarcely a lighted window in any of the houses and they had a
delicious sense of isolation,&mdash;the girl and the man awake in a
sleeping world. Annie made no further allusion to Miss Wallingford.
She had for almost the first time in her life a little selfish
feeling that she did not wish to jar a perfect moment even with the
contemplation of a friend's troubles. She was very happy walking
beside Von Rosen, holding up her flimsy embroidered skirts carefully
lest they come in contact with dewy grass. She had been admonished by
her grandmother and her aunts so to do and reminded that the frail
fabric would not endure much washing however skilful. Between the
shadows, her lovely face showed like a white flower as Von Rosen
looked down upon it. He wondered more and more that he had never
noticed this exquisite young creature before. He did not yet dream of
love in connection with her, but he was conscious of a passion of
surprised admiration and protectiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it that I have never seen you when I call on your
Aunt Harriet?&rdquo; he asked when he parted with her at her own
gate, a stately wrought iron affair in a tall hedge of close trimmed
lilac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am generally there, I think,&rdquo; replied Annie, but
she was also conscious of a little surprise that she had not paid
more attention when this young man, who looked at her so kindly,
called. Then came one of her sudden laughs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, except that the cat is usually there
too,&rdquo; replied Annie. Von Rosen looked back boyishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure I shall see you next time and hang the cat,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>When Annie was in her room unclasping her corals, she considered
how very much mortified and troubled her friend, Margaret Edes, must
feel. She recalled how hideous it had all been&mdash;that appearance
of the Western girl in the dining-room door-way, her rude ways, her
flushed angry face. Annie did not dream of blaming Margaret. She was
almost a fanatic as far as loyalty to her friends was concerned. She
loved Margaret and she had only a feeling of cold dislike and
disapprobation toward Miss Wallingford who had hurt Margaret. As for
that charge of &ldquo;trapping,&rdquo; she paid no heed to it
whatever. She made up her mind to go and see Margaret the very next
day and tell her a secret, a very great secret, which she was sure
would comfort her and make ample amends to her for all her distress
of the night before. Little Annie Eustace was so very innocent and
ignorant of the ways of the world that had her nearest and dearest
been able to look into her heart of hearts, they might have been
appalled, incredulous and reverent, according to their natures. For
instance, this very good, simple young girl who had been born with
the light of genius always assumed that her friends would be as
delighted at any good fortune of hers as at their own. She fairly fed
upon her admiration of Alice Mendon that evening when she had stepped
so nobly and tactfully into the rather frightful social breach and
saved, if not wholly, the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice was such a dear,&rdquo; she thought, and the thought
made her face fairly angelic. Then she recalled how lovely Alice had
looked, and her own mobile face took on unconsciously Alice's
expression. Standing before her looking-glass brushing out her hair,
she saw reflected, not her own beautiful face between the lustrous
folds, but Alice's. Then she recalled with pride Margaret's
imperturbability under such a trial. &ldquo;Nobody but Margaret could
have carried off such an insult under her own roof too,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>

<p>After she was in bed and her lamp blown out and the white
moon-beams were entering her open windows like angels, she, after
saying her prayers, thought of the three, Margaret, Alice, and Karl
von Rosen. Then suddenly a warm thrill passed over her long slender
body but it seemed to have its starting point in her soul. She saw
very distinctly the young man's dark handsome face, but she thought,
&ldquo;How absurd of me, to see him so distinctly, as distinctly as I
see Margaret and Alice, when I love them so much, and I scarcely know
Mr. von Rosen.&rdquo;  Being brought up by one's imperious
grandmother and two imperious aunts and being oneself naturally of an
obedient disposition and of a slowly maturing temperament, tends to
lengthen the long childhood of a girl. Annie was almost inconceivably
a child, much more of a child than Maida or Adelaide Edes. They had
been allowed to grow like weeds as far as their imagination was
concerned, and she had been religiously pruned.</p>

<p>The next afternoon she put on her white barred muslin and obtained
her Aunt Harriet's permission to spend an hour or two with Margaret
if she would work assiduously on her daisy centre piece, and stepped
like a white dove across the shady village street. Annie, unless she
remembered to do otherwise, was prone to toe in slightly with her
slender feet. She was also prone to allow the tail of her white gown
to trail. She gathered it up only when her Aunt called after her. She
found Margaret lying indolently in the hammock which was strung
across the wide shaded verandah. She was quite alone. Annie had seen
with relief Miss Martha Wallingford being driven to the station that
morning and the express following with her little trunk. Margaret
greeted Annie a bit stiffly but the girl did not notice it. She was
so full of her ignorant little plan to solace her friend with her own
joy. Poor Annie did not understand that it requires a nature seldom
met upon this earth, to be solaced, under disappointment and failure,
by another's joy. Annie had made up her mind to say very little to
Margaret about what had happened the evening before. Only at first,
she remarked upon the beauty of the dinner, then she said quite
casually, &ldquo;Dear Margaret, we were all so sorry for poor Miss
Wallingford's strange conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really did not matter in the least,&rdquo; replied
Margaret coldly. &ldquo;I shall never invite her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure nobody can blame you,&rdquo; said Annie warmly.
&ldquo;I don't want to say harsh things, you know that, Margaret, but
that poor girl, in spite of her great talent, cannot have had the
advantage of good home-training.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is Western,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;How very
warm it is to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very, but there is quite a breeze here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hot breeze,&rdquo; said Margaret wearily. &ldquo;How I
wish we could afford a house at the seashore or the mountains. The
hot weather does get on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great light of joy came into Annie's eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Margaret
dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can't do it yet but it does look as
if some time before long perhaps, I may be able myself to have a
house at the seashore. I think Sudbury beach would be lovely. It is
always cool there, and then you can come and stay with me whenever
you like during the hot weather. I will have a room fitted up for you
in your favourite white and gold and it shall be called Margaret's
room and you can always come, when you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret looked at the other girl with a slow surprise. &ldquo;I
do not understand,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you don't. You know we have only had enough to
live here as we have done,&rdquo; said Annie with really childish
glee, &ldquo;but oh, Margaret, you will be so glad. I have not told
you before but now I must for I know it will make you so happy, and I
know I can trust you never to betray me, for it is a great secret, a
very great secret, and it must not be known by other people at
present. I don't know just when it can be known, perhaps never,
certainly not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her with indifferent interrogation. Annie did
not realise how indifferent. A flood-tide of kindly joyful emotion
does not pay much attention to its banks. Annie continued. She looked
sweetly excited; her voice rose high above its usual pitch.
&ldquo;You understand, Margaret dear, how it is,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You see I am quite unknown, that is, my name is quite unknown,
and it would really hinder the success of a book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret surveyed her with awakening interest. &ldquo;A
book?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a book! Oh, Margaret, I know it will be hard for you
to believe, but you know I am very truthful. I&mdash;I wrote the book
they are talking about so much now. You know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>The Poor Lady</i>,&mdash;the anonymous novel which
people are talking so much about and which sold better than any other
book last week. I wrote it. I really did, Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie continued almost wildly. &ldquo;Yes, I did, I did!&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;and you are the only soul that knows except the
publishers. They said they were much struck with the book but advised
anonymous publication, my name was so utterly unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote <i>The Poor Lady</i>?&rdquo; said Margaret. Her
eyes glittered, and her lips tightened. Envy possessed her, but Annie
Eustace did not recognise envy when she saw it.</p>

<p>Annie went on in her sweet ringing voice, almost producing the
effect of a song. She was so happy, and so pleased to think that she
was making her friend happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wrote it. I wrote <i>The
Poor Lady</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;you speak quite so loud,
you will be heard by others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie lowered her voice immediately with a startled look.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I would not have anybody hear
me for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you manage?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>

<p>Annie laughed happily. &ldquo;I fear I have been a little
deceitful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I am sure they will forgive me
when they know. I keep a journal; I have always kept one since I was
a child. Aunt Harriet wished me to do so. And the journal was very
stupid. So little unusual happens here in Fairbridge, and I have
always been rather loath to write very much about my innermost
feelings or very much about my friends in my journal because of
course one can never tell what will happen. It has never seemed to me
quite delicate&mdash;to keep a very full journal, and so there was in
reality very little to write.&rdquo;  Annie burst into a peal of
laughter. &ldquo;It just goes this way, the journal,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;To-day is pleasant and warm. This morning I helped Hannah
preserve cherries. In the afternoon I went over to Margaret's and sat
with her on the verandah, embroidered two daisies and three leaves
with stems on my centre piece, came home, had supper, sat in the
twilight with Grandmother, Aunt Harriet and Aunt Susan. Went
upstairs, put on my wrapper and read until it was time to go to bed.
Went to bed. Now that took very little time and was not interesting
and so, after I went upstairs, I wrote my entry in the journal in
about five minutes and then I wrote <i>The Poor Lady</i>. Of course,
when I began it, I was not at all sure that it would amount to
anything. I was not sure that any publisher would look at it.
Sometimes I felt as if I were doing a very foolish thing: spending
time and perhaps deceiving Grandmother and my aunts very wickedly,
though I was quite certain that if the book should by any chance
succeed, they would not think it wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother is very fond of books and so is Aunt Harriet,
and I have often heard them say they wished I had been a boy in order
that I might do something for the Eustace name. You know there have
been so many distinguished professional men in the Eustace family and
they of course did not for one minute think a girl like me could do
anything and I did not really think so myself. Sometimes I wonder how
I had the courage to keep on writing when I was so uncertain but it
was exactly as if somebody were driving me. When I had the book
finished, I was so afraid it ought to be typewritten, but I could not
manage that. At least I thought I could not, but after awhile I did,
and in a way that nobody suspected, Aunt Harriet sent me to New York.
You know I am not often allowed to go alone but it was when
Grandmother had the grippe and Aunt Susan the rheumatism and Aunt
Harriet had a number of errands and so I went on the Twenty-third
Street ferry, and did not go far from Twenty-third Street and I took
my book in my handbag and carried it into Larkins and White's and I
saw Mr. Larkins in his office and he was very kind and polite,
although I think now he was laughing a little to himself at the idea
of my writing a book, but he said to leave the MSS. and he would let
me hear. And I left it and, oh, Margaret, I heard within a week, and
he said such lovely things about it. You know I always go to the
post-office, so there was no chance of anybody's finding it out that
way. And then the proof began to come and I was at my wits' end to
conceal that, but I did. And then the book was published, and,
Margaret, you know the rest. Nobody dreams who wrote it, and I have
had a statement and oh, my dear, next November I am to have a
check.&rdquo;  (Annie leaned over and whispered in Margaret's ear.)
&ldquo;Only think,&rdquo; she said with a burst of rapture.</p>

<p>Margaret was quite pale. She sat looking straight before her with
a strange expression. She was tasting in the very depths of her soul
a bitterness which was more biting than any bitter herb which ever
grew on earth. It was a bitterness, which, thank God, is unknown to
many; the bitterness of the envy of an incapable, but self-seeking
nature, of one with the burning ambition of genius but destitute of
the divine fire. To such come unholy torture, which is unspeakable at
the knowledge of another's success. Margaret Edes was inwardly
writhing. To think that Annie Eustace, little Annie Eustace, who had
worshipped at her own shrine, whom she had regarded with a lazy,
scarcely concealed contempt, for her incredible lack of wordly
knowledge, her provincialism, her ill-fitting attire, should have
achieved a triumph which she herself could never achieve. A cold
hatred of the girl swept over the woman. She forced her lips into a
smile, but her eyes were cruel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very interesting, my dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Poor Annie started. She was acute, for all her innocent trust in
another's goodness, and the tone of her friend's voice, the look in
her eyes chilled her. And yet she did not know what they signified.
She went on begging for sympathy and rejoicing with her joy as a
child might beg for a sweet. &ldquo;Isn't it perfectly lovely,
Margaret dear?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is most interesting, my dear child,&rdquo; replied
Margaret.</p>

<p>Annie went on eagerly with the details of her triumph, the book
sales which increased every week, the revises, the letters from her
publishers, and Margaret listened smiling in spite of her torture,
but she never said more than &ldquo;How interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Annie went home and could not help feeling disappointed,
although she could not fathom the significance of Margaret's
reception of her astonishing news. Annie only worried because she
feared lest her happiness had not cheered her friend as much as she
had anticipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Margaret, she must feel so very bad that nothing can
reconcile her to such a betrayal of her hospitality,&rdquo; she
reflected as she flitted across the street. There was nobody in
evidence at her house at window or on the wide verandah. Annie looked
at her watch tucked in her girdle, hung around her neck by a thin
gold chain which had belonged to her mother. It yet wanted a full
hour of supper time. She had time to call on Alice Mendon and go to
the post-office. Alice lived on the way to the post-office, in a
beautiful old colonial house. Annie ran along the shady sidewalk and
soon had a glimpse of Alice's pink draperies on her great front
porch. Annie ran down the deep front yard between the tall box
bushes, beyond which bloomed in a riot of colour and perfume roses
and lilies and spraying heliotrope and pinks and the rest of their
floral tribe all returned to their dance of summer. Alice's imposing
colonial porch was guarded on either side of the superb circling
steps by a stone lion from over seas. On the porch was a little table
and several chairs. Alice sat in one reading. She was radiant in her
pink muslin. Alice seldom wore white. She was quite sensible as to
the best combinations of herself with colours although she had,
properly speaking, no vanity. She arranged herself to the best
advantage as she arranged a flower in a vase. On the heavily carved
mahogany table beside her was a blue and white India bowl filled with
white roses and heliotrope and lemon verbena. Annie inhaled the
bouquet of perfume happily as she came up the steps with Alice
smiling a welcome at her. Annie had worshipped more fervently at
Margaret Edes' shrine than at Alice's and yet she had a feeling of
fuller confidence in Alice. She was about to tell Alice about her
book, not because Alice needed the comfort of her joy but because she
herself, although unknowingly, needed Alice's ready sympathy of which
she had no doubt. Her interview with Margaret had left the child hurt
and bewildered and now she came to Alice. Alice did not rise and kiss
her. Alice seldom kissed anybody but she radiated kindly welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, little Annie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am glad
you have come. My aunt and cousin have gone to New York and I have
been alone all day. We would have tea and cake but <em>I</em> know
the hour of your Medes and Persians' supper approaches instead of my
later dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie, sitting down, &ldquo;and if I were
to take tea and cake now, Alice, I could eat nothing and grandmother
and my aunts are very particular about my clearing my
plate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed, but she looked rather solicitously at the girl.
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, then she hesitated. She pitied little
Annie Eustace and considered her rather a victim of loving but
mistaken tyranny. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you
would stay and dine with me to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie fairly gasped. &ldquo;They expect me at home,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, and I suppose if I were to send over and tell them
you would dine with me, it would not answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked frightened. &ldquo;I fear not, Alice. You see they
would have had no time to think it over and decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have time to make you a little call and stop at the
post-office for the last mail and get home just in time for
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you must come and dine with me a week from
to-day, and I will have a little dinner-party,&rdquo; said Alice.
&ldquo;I will invite some nice people. We will have Mr. von Rosen for
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie suddenly flushed crimson. It occurred to her that Mr. von
Rosen might walk home with her as he had done from Margaret's, and a
longing and terror at once possessed her.</p>

<p>Alice wondered at the blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so sorry for poor Margaret last night,&rdquo; Annie
said with an abrupt change of subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That poor Western girl, talented as she is, must have been
oddly brought up to be so very rude to her hostess,&rdquo; said
Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say Western girls are brought up differently,&rdquo;
said Alice.</p>

<p>Annie was so intent with what she had to tell Alice that she did
not realise the extreme evasiveness of the other's manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, little Annie Eustace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie began, blushed, then hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to tell you something. I have told Margaret. I
have just told her this afternoon. I thought it might please her and
comfort her after that terrible scene at her dinner last night, but
nobody else knows except the publishers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Alice, regarding Annie with a
little smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only I wrote <i>The Poor Lady</i>,&rdquo; said
Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Annie, I knew it all the time,&rdquo; said
Alice.</p>

<p>Annie stared at her. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you did not know it, but you did repeat in that book
verbatim, ad literatim, a sentence, a very striking one, which
occurred in one of your papers which you wrote for the Zenith Club. I
noticed that sentence at the time. It was this: &lsquo;A rose has
enough beauty and fragrance to enable it to give very freely and yet
itself remain a rose. It is the case with many endowed natures but
that is a fact which is not always understood.&rsquo;  My dear Annie,
I knew that you wrote the book, for that identical sentence occurs in
<i>The Poor Lady</i> on page one hundred forty-two. You see I have
fully considered the matter to remember the exact page. I knew the
minute I read that sentence that my little Annie Eustace had written
that successful anonymous book, and I was the more certain because I
had always had my own opinion as to little Annie's literary ability
based upon those same Zenith Club papers. You will remember that I
have often told you that you should not waste your time writing club
papers when you could do work like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked alarmed. &ldquo;Oh, Alice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do
you think anybody else has remembered that sentence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I am quite sure that not a blessed woman in
that club has remembered that sentence,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had entirely forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very unfortunate if it were remembered, because
the publishers are so anxious that my name should not be known. You
see, nobody ever heard of me and my name would hurt the sales and the
poor publishers have worked so hard over the advertising, it would be
dreadful to have the sales fall off. You really don't think anybody
does remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Alice with her entirely good-natured,
even amused and tolerant air of cynicism, &ldquo;the women of the
Zenith Club remember their own papers. You need not have the
slightest fear. But Annie, you wonderful little girl, I am so glad
you have come to me with this. I have been waiting for you to tell
me, for I was impatient to tell you how delighted I am. You blessed
child, I never was more glad at anything in my whole life. I am as
proud as proud can be. I feel as if I had written that book myself,
and better than written it myself. I have had none of the bother of
the work and my friend had it and my friend has the fame and the
glory and she goes around among us with her little halo hidden out of
sight of everybody, except myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice stiffened a little. &ldquo;That is recent,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I have known all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret could not have remembered that sentence, I am
sure,&rdquo; Annie said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Poor Margaret, she was
so upset by what happened last night that I am afraid the news did
not cheer her up as much as I thought it would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you dear little soul,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;I am
simply revelling in happiness and pride because of it, you may be
sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not had such an awful blow as poor Margaret
had,&rdquo; said Annie. Then she brightened. &ldquo;Oh Alice,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;I wanted somebody who loved me to be
glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not told your grandmother and aunts
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not dared,&rdquo; replied Annie in a shamed fashion.
&ldquo;I know I deceived them and I think perhaps grandmother might
find it hard not to tell. She is so old you know, and she does tell a
great deal without meaning and Aunt Susan likes to tell news. I have
not dared, Alice. The publishers have been so very insistent that
nobody should know, but I had to tell you and Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It made no difference anyway about me,&rdquo; said Alice,
&ldquo;since I already knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret can be trusted too, I am sure,&rdquo; Annie said
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked at her watch. &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;or I shall be late. Isn't it really wonderful that I should
write a successful book, Alice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are rather wonderful, my dear,&rdquo; said Alice. Then
she rose and put her arms around the slender white-clad figure and
held her close, and gave her one of her infrequent kisses. &ldquo;You
precious little thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the book is wonderful,
but my Annie is more wonderful because she can be told so and never
get the fact into her head. Here is your work, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An expression of dismay came over Annie's face. &ldquo;Oh,
dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have only embroidered half a daisy
and what will Aunt Harriet say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have embroidered a whole garden as nobody else can, if
people only knew it,&rdquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Alice,&rdquo; said Annie ruefully, &ldquo;my embroidery
is really awful and I don't like to do it and the linen is so grimy
that I am ashamed. Oh, dear, I shall have to face Aunt Harriet with
that half daisy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed. &ldquo;She can't kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I don't like to have her so
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice kissed Annie again before she went, and watched the slight
figure flitting down between the box-rows, with a little frown of
perplexity. She wished that Annie had not told Margaret Edes about
the book and yet she did not know why she wished so. She was very far
from expecting the results. Alice was too noble herself to entertain
suspicions of the ignobility of others. Certainty she was obliged to
confront, as she had confronted the affair of the night before. It
was, of course, the certainty that Margaret had been guilty of a
disgraceful and treacherous deed which made her uneasy in a vague
fashion now and yet she did not for one second dream of what was to
occur at the next meeting of the Zenith Club.</p>

<p>That was at Mrs. Sturtevant's and was the great affair of the
year. It was called, to distinguish it from the others, &ldquo;The
Annual Meeting,&rdquo; and upon that occasion the husbands and men
friends of the members were invited and the function was in the
evening. Margaret had wished to have the club at her own house,
before the affair of Martha Wallingford, but the annual occasions
were regulated by the letters of the alphabet and it was
incontrovertibly the turn of the letter S and Mrs. Sturtevant's right
could not be questioned. During the time which elapsed before this
meeting, Margaret Edes was more actively unhappy than she had ever
been in her life and all her strong will could not keep the traces of
that unhappiness from her face. Lines appeared. Her eyes looked large
in dark hollows. Wilbur grew anxious about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go somewhere for a change,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I will get my cousin Marion to come here and keep house
and look out for the children. You must not be bothered even with
them. You need a complete rest and change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Margaret met his anxiety with irritation. She felt as if some
fatal fascination confined her in Fairbridge and especially did she
feel that she must be present at the annual meeting. Margaret never
for one minute formulated to herself why she had this fierce desire.
She knew in a horrible way at the back of her brain, but she kept the
knowledge covered as with a veil even from herself.</p>

<p>She had a beautiful new gown made for the occasion. Since she had
lost so much colour, she was doubtful of the wisdom of wearing her
favourite white and gold, or black. She had a crepe of a peculiar
shade of blue which suited her and she herself worked assiduously
embroidering it in a darker shade which brought out the colour of her
eyes. She looked quite herself when the evening came and Wilbur's
face brightened as he looked at her in her trailing blue with a
little diamond crescent fastening a tiny blue feather in her golden
fluff of hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly do look better,&rdquo; he said happily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well, you old goose,&rdquo; said Margaret, fastening
her long blue gloves. &ldquo;You have simply been fussing over
nothing as I told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope I have. You do look stunning to-night,&rdquo;
said Wilbur, gazing at her with a pride so intense that it was almost
piteous in its self-abnegation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your stunt there on the table?&rdquo; he inquired,
pointing to a long envelope.</p>

<p>Margaret laughed carefully, dimpling her cheeks.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and Wilbur took the envelope and put it
into his pocket. &ldquo;I will carry it for you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;By the way, what is your stunt, honey? Did you write
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, until you hear,&rdquo; replied Margaret, and she
laughed carefully again. She gathered up the train of her blue gown
and turned upon him, her blue eyes glowing with a strange fire,
feverish roses on her cheeks. &ldquo;You are not to be surprised at
anything to-night,&rdquo; she said and laughed again.</p>

<p>She still had a laughing expression when they were seated in Mrs.
Sturtevant's flower-scented drawing-room, a handsome room, thanks to
the decorator, who was young and enthusiastic. Margaret had duly
considered the colour scheme in her choice of a gown. The furniture
was upholstered with a wisteria pattern, except a few chairs which
were cane-seated, with silvered wood. Margaret had gone directly to
one of these chairs. She was not sure of her gown being exactly the
right shade of blue to harmonise with the wisteria at close quarters.
The chair was tall and slender. Margaret's feet did not touch the
floor, but the long blue trail of her gown concealed that, and she
contrived to sit as if they did. She gave the impression of a tall
creature of extreme grace as she sat propping her back against her
silvered chair. Wilbur gazed at her with adoration. He had almost
forgotten the affair of Martha Wallingford. He had excused his
Margaret because she was a woman and he was profoundly ignorant of
women's strange ambitions. Now, he regarded her with unqualified
admiration. He looked from her to the other women and back again and
was entirely convinced that she outshone them all as a sun a star. He
looked at the envelope in her blue lap and was sure that she had
written something which was infinitely superior to the work of any
other woman there. Down in the depths of his masculine soul, Wilbur
Edes had a sense of amused toleration when women's clubs were
concerned, but he always took his Margaret seriously, and the Zenith
Club on that account was that night an important and grave
organisation. He wished very much to smoke and he was wedged into an
uncomfortable corner with a young girl who insisted upon talking to
him and was all the time nervously rearranging her hair, but he had a
good view of his Margaret in her wonderful blue gown, in her silver
chair, and he was consoled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you read <i>The Poor Lady</i>?&rdquo; asked
spasmodically the girl, and drove in a slipping hair-pin at the same
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never read novels,&rdquo; replied Wilbur absently,
&ldquo;haven't much time you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose not, but that is such a wonderful book and
only think, nobody has the least idea who wrote it, and it does make
it so interesting. I thought myself it was written by Wilbur Jack
until I came to a sentence which I could quite understand and that
put him out of the question. Of course, Wilbur Jack is such a great
genius that no young girl like myself pretends to understand him, but
that is why I worship him. I tell Mamma I think he is the ideal
writer for young girls, so elevating. And then I thought <i>The Poor
Lady</i> might have been written by Mrs. Eudora Peasely because she
is always so lucid and I came to a sentence which I could not
understand at all. Oh, dear, I have thought of all the living writers
as writing that book and have had to give it up, and of course the
dead ones are out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Wilbur gravely, and then his
Margaret stood up and took some printed matter from an envelope and
instantly the situation became strangely tense. Men and women turned
eager faces; they could not have told why eager, but they were all
conscious of something unusual in the atmosphere and every expression
upon those expectant faces suddenly changed into one which made them
as a listening unit. Then Margaret began.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VII</h4>

<p>Wilbur Edes thought he had never seen his wife look as beautiful
as she did standing there before them all with those fluttering
leaves of paper in her hand. A breeze came in at an opposite window
and Margaret's blue feather tossed in it; her yellow hair crisped and
fluffed and the paper fluttered. Margaret stood for an appreciable
second surveying them all with a most singular expression. It was
compounded of honeyed sweetness, of triumph, and something else more
subtle, the expression of a warrior entering battle and ready for
death, yet terrible with defiance and the purpose of victory, and
death for his foe.</p>

<p>Then Margaret spoke and her thin silvery voice penetrated to every
ear in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Members of the Zenith Club and friends,&rdquo; said
Margaret, &ldquo;I take the opportunity offered me to-night to
disclose a secret which is a source of much joy to myself, and which
I am sure will be a source of joy to you also. I trust that since you
are my friends and neighbours and associates in club work, you will
acquit me of the charge of egotism and credit me with my whole
motive, which is, I think, not an unworthy one coming to you in joy,
as I would come in sorrow for your sympathy and understanding. I am
about to read an extract from a book whose success has given me the
most unqualified surprise and delight, knowing as I do that a reading
by an author from her own work always increases the interest even
though she may not be an able expositor by word of mouth of what she
has written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Margaret read. She had chosen a short chapter which was in
itself almost a complete little story. She read exceedingly well and
without faltering. People listened with ever-growing amazement. Then
Mrs. Jack Evarts whispered so audibly to a man at her side that she
broke in upon Margaret's clear recitative. &ldquo;Goodness, she's
reading from that book that is selling so,&mdash;<i>The Poor
Lady</i>&mdash;I remember every word of that chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then while Margaret continued her reading imperturbably, the
chorus of whispers increased. &ldquo;That is from <i>The Poor
Lady</i>, yes, it is. Did she write it? Why, of course, she did. She
just said so. Isn't it wonderful that she has done such a
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilbur Edes sat with his eyes riveted upon his wife's face, his
own gone quite pale, but upon it an expression of surprise and joy so
intense that he looked almost foolish from such a revelation of his
inner self.</p>

<p>The young girl beside him drove hair pins frantically into her
hair. She twisted up a lock which had strayed and fastened it. She
looked alternately at Wilbur and Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious,&rdquo; said she, and did not trouble to
whisper. &ldquo;That is the next to the last chapter of <i>The Poor
Lady</i>. And to think that your wife wrote it! Goodness gracious,
and here she has been living right here in Fairbridge all the time
and folks have been seeing her and talking to her and never knew! Did
you know, Mr. Edes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young girl fixed her sharp pretty eyes upon Wilbur.
&ldquo;Never dreamed of it,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;just as
much surprised as any of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe I could have kept such a wonderful thing as
that from my own husband,&rdquo; said the girl, who was unmarried,
and had no lover. But Wilbur did not hear. All he heard was his
beloved Margaret, who had secretly achieved fame for herself, reading
on and on. He had not the slightest idea what she was reading. He had
no interest whatever in that. All he cared for was the amazing fact
that his wife, his wonderful, beautiful Margaret, had so covered
herself with glory and honour. He had a slightly hurt feeling because
she had not told him until this public revelation. He felt that his
own private joy and pride as her husband should have been perhaps
sacred and respected by her and yet possibly she was right. This
public glory might have seemed to her the one which would the most
appeal to him.</p>

<p>He had, as he had said, not read the book, but he recalled with a
sort of rapturous tenderness for Margaret how he had seen the posters
all along the railroad as he commuted to the city, and along the
elevated road. His face gazing at Margaret was as beautiful in its
perfectly unselfish pride and affection, as a mother's. To think that
his darling had done such a thing! He longed to be at home alone with
her and say to her what he could not say before all these people. He
thought of a very good reason why she had chosen this occasion to
proclaim her authorship of the famous anonymous novel. She had been
so humiliated, poor child, by the insufferable rudeness of that
Western girl that she naturally wished to make good. And how modest
and unselfish she had been to make the attempt to exalt another
author when she herself was so much greater. Wilbur fully exonerated
Margaret for what she did in the case of Martha Wallingford in the
light of this revelation. His modest, generous, noble wife had
honestly endeavoured to do the girl a favour, to assist her in spite
of herself and she had received nothing save rudeness, ingratitude,
and humiliation in return. Now, she was asserting herself. She was
showing all Fairbridge that she was the one upon whom honour should
be showered. She was showing him and rightfully. He remembered with
compunction his severity toward her on account of the Martha
Wallingford affair, his beautiful, gifted Margaret! Why, even then
she might have electrified that woman's club by making the revelation
which she had won to-night and reading this same selection from her
own book. He had not read Martha Wallingford's <i>Hearts Astray</i>.
He thought that the title was enough for him. He knew that it must be
one of the womanish, hysterical, sentimental type of things which he
despised. But Margaret had been so modest that she had held back from
the turning on the search-light of her own greater glory. She had
made the effort which had resulted so disastrously to obtain a lesser
one, and he had condemned her. He knew that women always used
circuitous ways toward their results, just as men used sledge-hammer
ones. Why should a man criticise a woman's method any more than a
woman criticise a man's? Wilbur, blushing like a girl with pride and
delight, listened to his wife and fairly lashed himself. He was
wholly unworthy of such a woman, he knew.</p>

<p>When the reading was over and people crowded around Margaret and
congratulated her, he stood aloof. He felt that he could not speak of
this stupendous thing with her until they were alone. Then Doctor
Sturtevant's great bulk pressed against him and his sonorous voice
said in his ear, &ldquo;By Jove, old man, your wife has drawn a lucky
number. Congratulations.&rdquo;  Wilbur gulped as he thanked him.
Then Sturtevant went on talking about a matter which was rather dear
to Wilbur's own ambition and which he knew had been tentatively
discussed: the advisability of his running for State Senator in the
autumn. Wilbur knew it would be a good thing for him professionally,
and at the bottom of his heart he knew that his wife's success had
been the last push toward his own. Other men came in and began
talking, leading from his wife's success toward his own, until Wilbur
realised himself as dazzled.</p>

<p>He did not notice what Von Rosen noticed, because he had kept his
attention upon the girl, that Annie Eustace had turned deadly pale
when Margaret had begun her reading and that Alice Mendon who was
seated beside her had slipped an arm around her and quietly and
unobtrusively led her out of the room. Von Rosen thought that Miss
Eustace must have turned faint because of the heat, and was conscious
of a distinct anxiety and disappointment. He had, without directly
acknowledging it to himself, counted upon walking home with Annie
Eustace, but yet he hoped that she might return, that she had not
left the home. When the refreshments were served, he looked for her,
but Annie was long since at Alice Mendon's house in her room. Alice
had hurried her there in her carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come home with me, dear,&rdquo; she had whispered,
&ldquo;and we can have a talk together. Your people won't expect you
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore, while Karl von Rosen, who had gone to this annual
meeting of the Zenith Club for the sole purpose of walking home with
Annie, waited, the girl sat in a sort of dumb and speechless state in
Alice Mendon's room. It seemed to her like a bad dream. Alice herself
stormed. She had a high temper, but seldom gave way to it. Now she
did. There was something about this which roused her utmost powers of
indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is simply an outrage,&rdquo; declared Alice, marching up
and down the large room, her rich white gown trailing behind her, her
chin high. &ldquo;I did not think her capable of it. It is the worst
form of thievery in the world, stealing the work of another's brain.
It is inconceivable that Margaret Edes could have done such a
preposterous thing. I never liked her. I don't care if I do admit it,
but I never thought she was capable of such an utterly ignoble deed.
It was all that I could do to master myself, not to stand up before
them all and denounce her. Well, her time will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; said a ghastly little voice from the stricken
figure on the couch, &ldquo;are you sure? Am I sure? Was that from my
book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it was from your book. Why, you know it was from
your book, Annie Eustace,&rdquo; cried Alice and her voice sounded
high with anger toward poor Annie herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped that we might be mistaken after all,&rdquo; said
the voice, which had a bewildered quality. Annie Eustace had a nature
which could not readily grasp some of the evil of humanity. She was
in reality dazed before this. She was ready to believe an untruth
rather than the incredible truth. But Alice Mendon was merciless. She
resolved that Annie should know once for all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are neither of us mistaken,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Margaret Edes read a chapter from your book, <i>The Poor
Lady</i>, and without stating in so many words that she was the
author, she did what was worse. She made everybody think so. Annie,
she is bad, bad, bad. Call the spade a spade and face it. See how
black it is. Margaret Edes has stolen from you your best
treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care for that so much,&rdquo; said Annie Eustace,
&ldquo;but&mdash;I loved her, Alice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;she has stolen more than
your book. She has stolen the light by which you wrote it. It is
something hideous, hideous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie gave a queer little dry sob. &ldquo;Margaret could not have
done it,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>

<p>Alice crossed swiftly to her and knelt beside her.
&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must face it. It is
better. I do not say so because I do not personally like Margaret
Edes, but you must have courage and face it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not courage enough,&rdquo; said Annie and she felt
that she had not, for it was one of the awful tasks of the world
which was before her: The viewing the mutilated face of love
itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; said Alice. She put an arm around the
slight figure and drew the fair head to her broad bosom, her maternal
bosom, which served her friends in good stead, since it did not
pillow the heads of children. Friends in distress are as children to
the women of her type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she said in her stately voice from which
the anger had quite gone. &ldquo;Darling, you must face it. Margaret
did read that chapter from your book and she told, or as good as told
everybody that she had written it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Annie sobbed outright and the tears came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Oh, Alice, how she must want
success to do anything like that, poor, poor Margaret! Oh,
Alice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How she must love herself,&rdquo; said Alice firmly.
&ldquo;Annie, you must face it. Margaret is a self-lover; her whole
heart turns in love toward her own self, instead of toward those whom
she should love and who love her. Annie, Margaret is bad, bad, with a
strange degenerate badness. She dates back to the sins of the First
Garden. You must turn your back upon her. You must not love her any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I must not love her any more,&rdquo; agreed Annie,
&ldquo;and that is the pity of it. I must not love her, Alice, but I
must pity her until I die. Poor Margaret!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Annie,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;You worked so hard
over that book, dear, and you were so pleased. Annie, what shall you
do about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie raised her head from Alice's bosom and sat up straight, with
a look of terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I must go to-morrow and see
my publishers. I must go down on my knees to them if
necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; asked Alice slowly, &ldquo;never to
tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, never, never, never!&rdquo; cried Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;if you can keep such a
matter secret. I doubt if your publishers will consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must. I will never have it known! Poor
Margaret!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't pity her at all,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;I do
pity her husband who worships her, and there is talk of his running
for State Senator and this would ruin him. And I am sorry for the
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody shall ever know,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you manage with the publishers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will have written that really wonderful book and
never have the credit for it. You will live here and see Margaret
Edes praised for what you have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Margaret,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;I must go now. I
know I can trust you never to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but I do not think it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care whether it is right or not,&rdquo; said Annie.
&ldquo;It must never be known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are better than I am,&rdquo; said Alice as she rang the
bell, which was presently answered. &ldquo;Peter has gone home for
the night, Marie said,&rdquo; Alice told Annie, &ldquo;but Marie and
I will walk home with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice, it is only a step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, but it is late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much after ten, and&mdash;I would rather go
alone, if you don't mind, Alice. I want to get settled a little
before Aunt Harriet sees me. I can do it better alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Marie and I
will stand on the front porch until you are out of sight from there
and then we will go to the front gate. We can see nearly to your
house and we can hear if you call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night. The moon was high in a sky which was
perceptibly blue. In the west was still a faint glow, which was like
a memory of a cowslip sunset. The street and the white house-front
were plumy with soft tree shadows wavering in a gentle wind. Annie
was glad when she was alone in the night. She needed a moment for
solitariness and readjustment since one of the strongest
readjustments on earth faced her&mdash;the realisation that what she
had loved was not. She did not walk rapidly but lingered along the
road. She was thankful that neither of her aunts had been to the
annual meeting. She would not need to account for her time so
closely. Suddenly she heard a voice, quite a loud voice, a man's,
with a music of gladness in it. Annie knew instinctively whose it
was, and she stepped quickly upon a lawn and stood behind a clump of
trees. A man and woman passed her&mdash;Margaret Edes and her
husband&mdash;and Wilbur was saying in his glad, loving voice,
&ldquo;To think you should have done such a thing, Margaret, my dear,
you will never know how proud I am of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie heard Margaret's voice in a whisper hushing Wilbur.
&ldquo;You speak so loud, dear,&rdquo; said Margaret,
&ldquo;everybody will hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if they do,&rdquo; said Wilbur. &ldquo;I
should like to proclaim it from the housetops.&rdquo;  Then they
passed and the rose scent of Margaret's garments was in Annie's face.
She was glad that Margaret had hushed her husband. She argued that it
proved some little sense of shame, but oh, when all alone with her
own husband, she had made no disclaimer. Annie came out from her
hiding and went on. The Edes ahead of her melted into the shadows but
she could still hear Wilbur's glad voice. The gladness in it made her
pity Margaret more. She thought how horrible it must be to deceive
love like that, to hear that joyful tone, and know it all undeserved.
Then suddenly she heard footsteps behind and walked to one side to
allow whoever it was to pass, but a man's voice said: &ldquo;Good
evening, Miss Eustace,&rdquo; and Von Rosen had joined her. He had in
truth been waiting like any village beau near Alice Mendon's house
for the chance of her emerging alone.</p>

<p>Annie felt annoyed, and yet her heart beat strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. von Rosen,&rdquo; she said and still
lingered as if to allow him to pass, but he slowed his own pace and
sauntered by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine evening,&rdquo; he remarked tritely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you at the evening club,&rdquo; said Von Rosen
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;I was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I left quite early with Alice. I have been with her
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie wondered if Mr. von Rosen suspected anything but his next
words convinced her that he did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that you were as much surprised as the rest of
us, although you are her intimate friend, at Mrs. Edes' announcement
concerning the authorship of that successful novel,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you had no idea that she had written
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it? I almost never read novels but I
suppose I must tackle that one. Did you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what is it all about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie could endure no more. &ldquo;It will spoil the book for you
if I tell you, Mr. von Rosen,&rdquo; said she, and her voice was at
once firm and piteous. She could not tell the story of her own book
to him. She would be as deceitful as poor Margaret, for all the time
he would think she was talking of Margaret's work and not of her
own.</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed. After all he cared very little indeed about the
book. He had what he cared for: a walk home with this very sweet and
very natural girl, who did not seem to care whether he walked home
with her or not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
doubt if your telling me about it would spoil the book for me,
because it is more than probable that I shall never read it after
all. I may if it comes in my way because I was somewhat surprised. I
had never thought of Mrs. Edes as that sort of person. However, so
many novels are written nowadays, and some mighty queer ones are
successful that I presume I should not be surprised. Anybody in
Fairbridge might be the author of a successful novel. You might, Miss
Eustace, for all I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. He had not the
least idea of the thinness of the ice. Annie trembled. Her
truthfulness was as her life. She hated even evasions. Luckily Von
Rosen was so far from suspicion that he did not wait for an
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Edes reads well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed,&rdquo; returned Annie eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose an author can read more understandingly from her
own work,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. &ldquo;Don't you think so, Miss
Eustace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she might,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know but I shall read that book after all,&rdquo;
said Von Rosen. &ldquo;I rather liked that extract she gave us. It
struck me as out of the common run of women's books. I beg your
pardon, Miss Eustace. If you were a writer yourself I could not speak
so, but you are not, and you must know as well as I do, that many of
the books written by women are simply sloughs of oversweetened
sentiment, and of entirely innocent immorality. But that chapter did
not sound as if it could belong to such a book. It sounded altogether
too logical for the average woman writer. I think I will read it.
Then after I have read it, you will not refuse to discuss it with me,
will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; replied Annie tremulously. Would
he never talk of anything except that book? To her relief he did, to
her relief and scarcely acknowledged delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you interested in curios, things from Egyptian tombs,
for instance?&rdquo; he inquired with brutal masculine disregard of
sequence.</p>

<p>Annie was bewildered, but she managed to reply that she thought
she might be. She had heard of Von Rosen's very interesting
collection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to meet your aunt, Miss Harriet, this
afternoon,&rdquo; said Von Rosen, &ldquo;and I inquired if she were
by any chance interested and she said she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie. She had never before dreamed that
her Aunt Harriet was in the least interested in Egyptian tombs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ventured to ask if she and her sister, Miss Susan, and
you also, if you cared to see it, would come some afternoon and look
at my collection,&rdquo; said Von Rosen.</p>

<p>Nobody could have dreamed from his casual tone how carefully he
had planned it all out: the visit of Annie and her aunts, the
delicate little tea served in the study, the possible little stroll
with Annie in his garden. Von Rosen knew that one of the aunts, Miss
Harriet, was afflicted with rose cold, and therefore, would probably
not accept his invitation to view his rose-garden, and he also knew
that it was improbable that both sisters would leave their aged
mother. It was, of course, a toss-up as to whether Miss Harriet or
Miss Susan would come. It was also a toss-up as to whether or not
they might both come, and leave little Annie as companion for the old
lady. In fact, he had to admit to himself that the latter contingency
was the more probable. He was well accustomed to being appropriated
by elder ladies, with the evident understanding that he preferred
them. He would simply have to make the best of it and show his
collection as gracefully as possible and leave out the rose-garden
and the delicious little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with this
young rose of a girl and think of something else. For Karl von Rosen
in these days was accustoming himself to a strange visage in his own
mental looking-glass. He had not altered his attitude toward women
but toward one woman, and that one was now sauntering beside him in
the summer moonlight, her fluffy white garments now and then blowing
across his sober garb. He was conscious of holding himself in a very
tight rein. He wondered how long men were usually about their
love-making. He wished to make love that very instant, but he feared
lest the girl might be lost by such impetuosity. In all likelihood,
the thought of love in connection with himself had never entered her
mind. Why should it? Karl in love was very modest and saw himself as
a very insignificant figure. Probably this flower-like young creature
had never thought of love at all. She had lived her sweet simple
village life. She had obeyed her grandmother and her aunts, done her
household tasks and embroidered. He remembered the grimy bit of linen
which he had picked up and he could not see the very slightest
connection between that sort of thing and love and romance. Of
course, she had read a few love stories and the reasoning by analogy
develops in all minds. She might have built a few timid air castles
for herself upon the foundations of the love stories in fiction, and
this brought him around to the fatal subject again almost
inevitably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Miss Eustace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am
wishing a very queer thing about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Mr. von Rosen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am wishing, you know that I would not esteem you more
highly, it is not that, but I am wishing that you also had written a
book, a really good sort of love story, novel, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't mean because Mrs. Edes wrote <i>The Poor Lady</i>.
It is not that. I am quite sure that you could have written a book
every whit as good as hers but what I do mean is&mdash;I feel that a
woman writer if she writes the best sort of book must obtain a
certain insight concerning human nature which requires a long time
for most women.&rdquo;  Von Rosen was rather mixed, but Annie did not
grasp it. She was very glad that they were nearing her own home. She
could not endure much more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <i>The Poor Lady</i> a love story?&rdquo; inquired Von
Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a little love in it,&rdquo; replied Annie
faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly read it,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. He shook
hands with Annie at her gate and wanted to kiss her. She looked up in
his face like an adorably timid, trustful little child and it seemed
almost his duty to kiss her, but he did not. He said good-night and
again mentioned his collection of curios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will feel inclined to come and see them,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;with&mdash;your aunts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Annie, &ldquo;I shall be very
glad to come, if both Aunt Harriet and Aunt Susan do not. That would
of course oblige me to stay with grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Von Rosen, but he said inwardly,
&ldquo;Hang Grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his inmost self, Von Rosen was not a model clergyman. He,
however, had no reason whatever to hang grandmother, but quite the
reverse, although he did not so conclude, as he considered the matter
on his way home. It seemed to him that this darling of a girl was
fairly hedged in by a barbed wire fence of feminine relatives.</p>

<p>He passed the Edes' house on his way and saw that a number of the
upper windows were still lighted. He even heard a masculine voice
pitched on a high cadence of joy and triumph. He smiled a little
scornfully. &ldquo;He thinks his wife is the most wonderful woman in
the world,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and I dare say that a novel
is simply like an over-sweetened ice-cream, with an after taste of
pepper, out of sheer deviltry.&rdquo;  Had he known it, Margaret Edes
herself was tasting pepper, mustard and all the fierce condiments
known, in her very soul. It was a singular thing that Margaret had
been obliged to commit an ignoble deed in order to render her soul
capable of tasting to the full, but she had been so constituted. As
Karl von Rosen passed that night, she was sitting in her room, clad
in her white silk negligee and looking adorable, and her husband was
fairly on his knees before her, worshipping her, and she was
suffering after a fashion hitherto wholly uncomprehended by her.
Margaret had never known that she could possibly be to blame for
anything, that she could sit in judgment upon herself. Now she knew
it and the knowledge brought a torture which had been unimaginable by
her. She strove not to make her shrinking from her husband and his
exultation&mdash;her terrified shrinking&mdash;evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Margaret, you are simply wonderful beyond words,&rdquo;
said Wilbur, gazing up into her face. &ldquo;I always knew you were
wonderful, of course, darling, but this! Why, Margaret, you have
gained an international reputation from that one book! And the
reviews have been unanimous, almost unanimous in their praise. I have
not read it, dear. I am so ashamed of myself, but you know I never
read novels, but I am going to read my Margaret's novel. Oh, my dear,
my wonderful, wonderful dear!&rdquo;  Wilbur almost sobbed. &ldquo;Do
you know what it may do for me, too?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you
know, Margaret, it may mean my election as Senator. One can never
tell what may sway popular opinion. Once, if anybody had told me that
I might be elected to office and my election might possibly be due to
the fact that my wife had distinguished myself, I should have been
humbled to the dust. But I cannot be humbled by any success which may
result from your success. I did not know my wonderful Margaret
then.&rdquo;  Wilbur kissed his wife's hands. He was almost
ridiculous, but it was horribly tragic for Margaret.</p>

<p>She longed as she had never longed for anything in her life, for
the power to scream, to shout in his ears the truth, but she could
not. She was bound hard and fast in the bands of her own falsehood.
She could not so disgrace her husband, her children. Why had she not
thought of them before? She had thought only of herself and her own
glory, and that glory had turned to stinging bitterness upon her
soul. She was tasting the bitterest medicine which life and the whole
world contains. And at the same time, it was not remorse that she
felt. That would have been easier. What she endured was
self-knowledge. The reflection of one's own character under unbiased
cross-lights is a hideous thing for a self-lover. She was thinking,
while she listened to Wilbur's rhapsodies. Finally she scarcely heard
him. Then her attention was suddenly keenly fixed. There were
horrible complications about this which she had not considered.
Margaret's mind had no business turn. She had not for a moment
thought of the financial aspect of the whole. Wilbur was different.
What he was now saying was very noble, but very disconcerting.
&ldquo;Of course, I know, darling, that all this means a pile of
money, but one thing you must remember: it is for yourself alone. Not
one penny of it will I ever touch and more than that it is not to
interfere in the least with my expenditures for you, my wife, and the
children. Everything of that sort goes on as before. You have the
same allowance for yourself and the children as before. Whatever
comes from your book is your own to do with as you choose. I do not
even wish you to ask my advice about the disposal of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret was quite pale as she looked at him. She remembered now
the sum which Annie had told her she was to receive. She made no
disclaimer. Her lips felt stiff. While Wilbur wished for no
disclaimer, she could yet see that he was a little surprised at
receiving none, but she could not speak. She merely gazed at him in a
helpless sort of fashion. The grapes which hung over her friend's
garden wall were not very simple. They were much beside grapes.
Wilbur returned her look pityingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; he said, kissing her hands again;
&ldquo;she is all tired out and I must let her go to bed. Standing on
a pedestal is rather tiresome, if it is gratifying, isn't it,
sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a weary sigh from her
heart. How little the poor man knew of the awful torture of standing
upon the pedestal of another, and at the same time holding before
one's eyes that looking-glass with all the cross-lights of existence
full upon it!</p>

<p>Margaret went to bed, but she could not sleep. All night long she
revolved the problem of how she should settle the matter with Annie
Eustace. She did not for a second fear Annie's betrayal, but there
was that matter of the publishers. Would they be content to allow
matters to rest?</p>

<p>The next morning Margaret endeavoured to get Annie on the
telephone but found that she had gone to New York. Annie's Aunt
Harriet replied. She herself had sent the girl on several
errands.</p>

<p>Margaret could only wait. She feared lest Annie might not return
before Wilbur and in such a case she could not discuss matters with
her before the next day. Margaret had a horrible time during the next
six hours. The mail was full of letters of congratulation. A local
reporter called to interview her. She sent word that she was out, but
he was certain that he had seen her. The children heard the news and
pestered her with inquiries about her book and wondering looks at
her. Callers came in the afternoon and it was all about her book.
Nobody could know how relieved she was after hearing the four-thirty
train, to see little Annie Eustace coming through her gate. Annie
stood before her stiffly. The day was very warm and the girl looked
tired and heated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can not sit down.
I only stopped to tell you that I have arranged with the publishers.
They will keep the secret. I shall have rather a hard task arranging
about the checks, because I fear it will involve a little deceit and
I do not like deceit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie, as she spoke, looked straight at Margaret and there was
something terrible in that clear look of unsoiled truth. Margaret put
out a detaining hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down for a minute, please,&rdquo; she said cringingly.
&ldquo;I want to explain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing whatever to explain,&rdquo; replied Annie.
&ldquo;I heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;that this is an
ordinary offence about which to talk of forgiveness. I do pity you,
Margaret, for I realise how dreadfully you must have wanted what did
not belong to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret winced. &ldquo;Well, if it is any satisfaction to you, I
am realising nothing but misery from it,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see how you can help that,&rdquo; replied Annie
simply. Then she went away.</p>

<p>It proved Margaret's unflinching trust in the girl and Annie's
recognition of no possibility except that trust, that no request nor
promise as to secrecy had been made. Annie, after she got home,
almost forgot the whole for a time, since her Aunt Harriet, and Aunt
Harriet was the sister who was subject to rose-colds, announced her
determination to call at Mr. von Rosen's the next afternoon with
Annie and see his famous collection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the invitation was meant
particularly for me, since I am one of his parishioners, and I think
it will be improving to you, Annie, to view antiquities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Harriet,&rdquo; said Annie. She was wondering if
she would be allowed to wear her pale blue muslin and the turquoise
necklace which was a relic of her grandmother's girlhood. Aunt Susan
sniffed delicately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay with Mother,&rdquo; she said with a virtuous
air.</p>

<p>The old lady, stately in her black satin, with white diamonds
gleaming on her veinous hands, glanced acutely at them. The next day,
when her daughter Harriet insisted that the cross barred muslin was
not too spoiled to wear to the inspection of curios, she declared
that it was simply filthy, and that Annie must wear her blue, and
that the little string of turquoise beads was not in the least too
dressy for the occasion.</p>

<p>It therefore happened that Annie and her Aunt Harriet set forth at
three o'clock in the afternoon, Annie in blue, and her aunt in thin
black grenadine with a glitter of jet and a little black bonnet with
a straight tuft of green rising from a little wobble of jet, and a
black-fringed parasol tilted well over her eyes. Annie's charming
little face was framed in a background of white parasol. Margaret saw
them pass as she sat on her verandah. She had received more
congratulatory letters that day, and the thief envied the one from
whom she had taken. Annie bowed to Margaret, and her Aunt Harriet
said something about the heat, in a high shrill voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a wonderful woman, to have written that successful
novel,&rdquo; said Aunt Harriet, &ldquo;and I am going to write her a
congratulatory note, now you have bought that stationery at
Tiffany's. I feel that such a subject demands special paper. She is a
wonderful woman and her family have every reason to be proud of
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather odd, and I have often thought so,&rdquo; said
Aunt Harriet, moving alongside with stately sweeps of black skirts,
&ldquo;that you have shown absolutely no literary taste. As you know,
I have often written poetry, of course not for publication, and my
friends have been so good as to admire it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Harriet,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I realise that you have never appreciated my poems,&rdquo;
said Aunt Harriet tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think I understand poetry very well,&rdquo; little
Annie said with meekness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does require a peculiar order of mind, and you have
never seemed to me in the least poetical or imaginative,&rdquo; said
her aunt in an appeased voice. &ldquo;For instance, I could not
imagine your writing a book like Mrs. Edes, and <i>The Poor Lady</i>
was anonymous, and anybody might have written it as far as one knew.
But I should never have imagined her for a moment as capable of doing
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>Then they had come to the parsonage and Jane Riggs, as rigid as
starched linen could make a human being, admitted them, and presently
after a little desultory conversation, the collection, which was
really a carefully made one, and exceedingly good and interesting,
was being displayed. Then came the charming little tea which Von
Rosen had planned; then the suggestion with regard to the rose-garden
and Aunt Harriet's terrified refusal, knowing as she knew the agony
of sneezes and sniffs sure to follow its acceptance; and then Annie,
a vision in blue, was walking among the roses with Von Rosen and both
were saying things which they never could remember
afterward&mdash;about things in which neither had the very slightest
interest. It was only when they had reached the end of the pergola,
trained over with climbers, and the two were seated on a rustic bench
therein, that the conversation to be remembered began.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VIII</h4>

<p>The conversation began, paradoxically, with a silence. Otherwise,
it would have begun with platitudes. Since neither Von Rosen nor
Annie Eustace were given usually to platitudes, the silence was
unavoidable. Both instinctively dreaded with a pleasurable dread the
shock of speech. In a way this was the first time the two had been
alone with any chance of a seclusion protracted beyond a very few
minutes. In the house was Aunt Harriet Eustace, who feared a rose, as
she might have feared the plague, and, moreover, as Annie comfortably
knew, had imparted the knowledge to Von Rosen as they had walked down
the pergola, that she would immediately fall asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Harriet always goes to sleep in her chair after a cup
of tea,&rdquo; Annie had said and had then blushed redly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; asked Von Rosen with apparent
absent-mindedness but in reality, keenly. He excused himself for a
moment, left Annie standing in the pergola and hurried back to the
house, where he interviewed Jane Riggs, and told her not to make any
noise, as Miss Eustace in the library would probably fall asleep, as
was her wont after a cup of tea. Jane Riggs assented, but she looked
after him with a long, slow look. Then she nodded her head stiffly
and went on washing cups and saucers quietly. She spoke only one
short sentence to herself. &ldquo;He's a man and it's got to be
somebody. Better be her than anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the two at the end of the pergola began talking, it was
strangely enough about the affair of the Syrian girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, have always supposed, that the poor young
thing's husband came and stole his little son,&rdquo; said Von
Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have adopted him?&rdquo; asked Annie in a shy
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I would not have known any other course to
take,&rdquo; replied Von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very good of you,&rdquo; Annie said. She cast a
little glance of admiration at him.</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed. &ldquo;It is not goodness which counts to one's
credit when one is simply chucked into it by Providence,&rdquo; he
returned.</p>

<p>Annie laughed. &ldquo;To think of your speaking of Providence as
&lsquo;chucking.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rather awful,&rdquo; admitted Von Rosen, &ldquo;but
somehow I never do feel as if I need be quite as straight-laced with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. von Rosen, you have talked with me exactly twice, and I
am at a loss as to whether I should consider that remark of yours as
a compliment or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant it for one,&rdquo; said Von Rosen earnestly.
&ldquo;I should not have used that expression. What I meant was I
felt that I could be myself with you, and not weigh words or split
hairs. A clergyman has to do a lot of that, you know, Miss Eustace,
and sometimes (perhaps all the time) he hates it; it makes him feel
like a hypocrite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is all right,&rdquo; said Annie rather vaguely. She
gazed up at the weave of leaves and blossoms, then down at the
wavering carpet of their shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lovely here,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The young man looked at the slender young creature in the blue
gown and smiled with utter content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very odd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but nothing except
blue and that particular shade of blue would have
harmonised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have said green or pink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would surely have clashed. If you can't melt into
nature, it is much safer to try for a discord. You are much surer to
chord. That blue does chord, and I doubt if a green would not have
been a sort of swear word in colour here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you like it,&rdquo; said Annie like a school
girl. She felt very much like one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; Von Rosen said abruptly.</p>

<p>Annie said nothing. She sat very still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't like you. I love you,&rdquo; said Von
Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you? You have talked with me only twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference with me. Does it with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;but I am not at all sure
about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what my aunts and grandmother will say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will object to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No-o.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it makes you doubtful? I have a little fortune of
my own. I have an income besides my salary. I can take care of you.
They can trust you to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked at him with a quick flush of resentment. &ldquo;As if
I would even think of such a thing as that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will laugh, but grandmother is very old, although she
sits up so straight, and she depends on me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I married you, I could not, of course, play pinocle with
grandmother on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you could. I most certainly should not
object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that makes it hopeless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen looked at her in perplexity. &ldquo;I am afraid I don't
understand you, dear little soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you do not. You see, grandmother is in reality very
good, almost too good to live, and thinking she is being a little
wicked playing pinocle on Sunday when Aunt Harriet and Aunt Susan
don't know it, sort of keeps her going. I don't just know why myself,
but I am sure of it. Now the minute she was sure that you, who are
the minister, did not object, she would not care a bit about pinocle
and it would hurt her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie looked inconceivably young. She knitted her candid brows and
stared at him with round eyes of perplexity. Karl von Rosen shouted
with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if that is all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I object
strenuously to your playing pinocle with your grandmother on Sunday.
The only way you can manage will be to play hookey from
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need not do that always,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;My
aunts take naps Sunday afternoons, but I am sure grandmother could
keep awake if she thought she could be wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can either play hookey from church, or run away
Sunday afternoons, or if you prefer and she is able, I will drive
your grandmother over here and you can play pinocle in my
study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I do think she will live to be a hundred,&rdquo; said
Annie with a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop laughing and kiss me,&rdquo; said Von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seldom kiss anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Annie looked up from her lover's shoulder, a pair of topaz
eyes were mysteriously regarding her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cat never saw me kiss anybody,&rdquo; said Von
Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the cat knows?&rdquo; asked Annie, blushing
and moving away a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows what any animal knows or does not know?&rdquo;
replied Von Rosen. &ldquo;When we discover that mystery, we may have
found the key to existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the cat sprang into Annie's blue lap and she stroked his
yellow back and looked at Von Rosen with eyes suddenly reflective,
rather coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, I, nor nobody else, ever heard of such a thing
as this,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do you mean that you consider this
an engagement?&rdquo; she asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we have only really seen and talked to each other
twice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been all our lives and we have just found it
out,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. &ldquo;Of course, it is unusual, but who
cares? Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; said Annie. They leaned together over
the yellow cat and kissed each other.</p>

<img src="images/bh3.jpg" width="725" height="1098"
alt="[Illustration: They leaned together over the yellow cat and
kissed each other]">

<p>&ldquo;But what an absurd minister's wife I shall be,&rdquo; said
Annie. &ldquo;To think of your marrying a girl who has staid at home
from church and played cards with her grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not at all sure,&rdquo; said Von Rosen, &ldquo;that
you do not get more benefit, more spiritual benefit, than you would
have done from my sermons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;that you are just about
as funny a minister as I shall be a minister's wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought I should be married at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not care for women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden movement in front of them. The
leaf-shadows flickered; the cat jumped down from Annie's lap and ran
away, his great yellow plume of tail waving angrily, and Margaret
Edes stood before them. She was faultlessly dressed as usual. A woman
of her type cannot be changed utterly by force of circumstances in a
short time. Her hat was loaded with wisteria. She wore a wisteria
gown of soft wool. She held up her skirts daintily. A great amethyst
gleamed at her throat, but her face, wearing a smile like a painted
one, was dreadful. It was inconceivable, but Margaret Edes had
actually in view the banality of confessing her sin to her minister.
Of course, Annie was the one who divined her purpose. Von Rosen was
simply bewildered. He rose, and stood with an air of polite
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; cried Annie, &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man thought that his sweetheart was simply embarrassed,
because of discovery. He did not understand why she bade him
peremptorily to please go in the house and see if Aunt Harriet were
awake, that she wished to speak to Mrs. Edes. He, however, went as
bidden, already discovering that man is as a child to a woman when
she is really in earnest.</p>

<p>When he was quite out of hearing, Annie turned upon her friend.
&ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Margaret, you must
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret turned her desperate eyes upon Annie. &ldquo;I did not
know it would be like this,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not, and all the more now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he ought to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he ought not to know, for you have drawn me into your
web of deceit also. He has talked to me about you and the book. I
have not betrayed you. You cannot betray me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will kill me. I did not know it would be like this. I
never blamed myself for anything before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not kill you, and if it does, you must bear it. You
must not do your husband and children such an awful harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilbur is nominated for Senator. He would have to give it
up. He would go away from Fairbridge. He is very proud,&rdquo; said
Margaret in a breathless voice, &ldquo;but I must tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children talk of it all the time. They look at me so.
They wonder because they think I have written that book. They tell
all the other children. Annie, I must confess to somebody. I did not
know it would be like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot confess to anybody except God,&rdquo; said
Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell my husband. I cannot tell poor Wilbur, but I
thought Mr. von Rosen would tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can not tell Mr. von Rosen. You have done an awful
wrong, and now you can not escape the fact that you have done it. You
cannot get away from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not hard,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;I did not
betray you there before them all, and neither did Alice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Alice Mendon know?&rdquo; asked Margaret in an awful
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had told Alice. She was so hurt for me that I think
she might have told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she may tell now. I will go to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will not tell now. And I am not hard. It is you who are
hard upon yourself and that nobody, least of all I, can help. You
will have to know this dreadful thing of yourself all your life and
you can never stop blaming yourself. There is no way out of it. You
can not ruin your husband. You can not ruin your children's future
and you cannot, after the wrong you have done me, put me in the
wrong, as you would do if you told. By telling the truth, you would
put me to the lie, when I kept silence for your sake and the sakes of
your husband and children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know it would be like this,&rdquo; said Margaret
in her desperate voice. &ldquo;I had done nothing worth doing all my
life and the hunger to do something had tormented me. It seemed easy,
I did not know how I could blame myself. I have always thought so
well of myself; I did not know. Annie, for God's sake, let me tell.
You can't know how keenly I suffer, Annie. Let me tell Mr. von Rosen.
People always tell ministers. Even if he does not tell Wilbur, but
perhaps he can tell him and soften it, it would be a relief. People
always tell ministers, Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed improbable that Margaret Edes in her wisteria costume
could be speaking. Annie regarded her with almost horror. She pitied
her, yet she could not understand. Margaret had done something of
which she herself was absolutely incapable. She had the right to
throw the stone. She looked at a sinner whose sin was beyond her
comprehension. She pitied the evident signs of distress, but her
pity, although devoid of anger, was, in spite of herself, coldly
wondering. Moreover, Margaret had been guilty in the eyes of the girl
of a much worse sin than the mere thievery of her book; she had
murdered love. Annie had loved Margaret greatly. No, she loved her no
longer, since the older woman had actually blasphemed against the
goddess whom the girl had shrined. Had Margaret stolen from another,
it would have made no difference. The mere act had destroyed herself
as an image of love. Annie, especially now that she was so happy,
cared nothing for the glory of which she had been deprived. She had,
in truth, never had much hunger for fame, especially for herself. She
did not care when she thought how pleased her lover would have been
and her relatives, but already the plan for another book was in her
brain, for the child was a creator, and no blow like this had any
lasting power over her work. What she considered was Margaret's
revelation of herself as something else than Margaret, and what she
did resent bitterly was being forced into deception in order to
shield her. She was in fact hard, although she did not know it. Her
usually gentle nature had become like adamant before this. She felt
unlike herself as she said bitterly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;People do not always tell ministers, and you cannot tell
Mr. von Rosen, Margaret. I forbid it. Go home and keep
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are going to give me a dinner, the Zenith Club,&rdquo;
said Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Annie Eustace, of what do you think me capable? I
am not as bad as you think. I cannot and will not accept that dinner
and make the speech which they will expect and hear all the
congratulations which they will offer. I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must accept the dinner, but I don't see that you need
make the speech,&rdquo; said Annie, who was herself aghast over such
extremity of torture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said Margaret. She was very pale and her
lips were a tight line. Her eyes were opaque and lustreless. She was
in reality suffering what a less egotistical nature could not even
imagine. All her life had Margaret Edes worshipped and loved Margaret
Edes. Now she had done an awful thing. The falling from the pedestal
of a friend is nothing to hurling oneself from one's height of
self-esteem and that she had done. She stood, as it were, over the
horrible body of her once beautiful and adored self. She was not
actually remorseful and that made it all the worse. She simply could
not evade the dreadful glare of light upon her own imperfections; she
who had always thought of herself as perfect, but the glare of
knowledge came mostly from her appreciation of the attitude of her
friends and lovers toward what she had done. Suppose she went home
and told Wilbur. Suppose she said, &ldquo;I did not write that book.
My friend, Annie Eustace, wrote it. I am a thief, and worse than a
thief.&rdquo;  She knew just how he would look at her, his wife, his
Margaret, who had never done wrong in his eyes. For the first time in
her life she was afraid, and yet how could she live and bear such
torture and not confess? Confession would be like a person ill unto
death, giving up, and seeking the peace of a sick chamber and the
rest of bed and the care of a physician. She had come to feel like
that and yet, confession would be like a fiery torture. Margaret had
in some almost insane fashion come to feel that she might confess to
a minister, a man of God, and ease her soul, without more. And she
had never been religious, and would have formerly smiled in serene
scorn at her own state of mind. And here was the other woman whom she
had wronged, forbidding her this one little possibility of
comfort.</p>

<p>She said again humbly, &ldquo;Let me tell him, Annie. He will only
think the more of you because you shielded me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Annie was full of scorn which Margaret could not understand
since her nature was not so fine. &ldquo;Do you think I wish him
to?&rdquo; she said, but in a whisper because she heard voices and
footsteps. &ldquo;You cannot tell him, Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Von Rosen and Aunt Harriet, whose eyes were dim with recent
sleep, came in sight, and Harriet Eustace, who had not seen Margaret
since the club meeting, immediately seized upon her two hands and
kissed her and congratulated her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dear, wonderful creature,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we
are all so proud of you. Fairbridge is so proud of you and as for us,
we can only feel honoured that our little Annie has such a friend. We
trust that she will profit by your friendship and we realise that it
is such a privilege for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Margaret. She turned her head aside.
It was rather dreadful, and Annie realised it.</p>

<p>Von Rosen stood by smiling. &ldquo;I am glad to join in the
congratulations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In these days of many books,
it is a great achievement to have one singled out for special notice.
I have not yet had the pleasure of reading the book, but shall
certainly have it soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Margaret again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She should give you an autograph copy,&rdquo; said Harriet
Eustace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret. She drew aside Annie and
whispered, &ldquo;I shall tell my husband then. I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she bade them good afternoon in her usually graceful way;
murmured something about a little business which she had with Annie
and flitted down the pergola in a cloud of wisteria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem wonderful,&rdquo; said Harriet Eustace,
&ldquo;that she should have written that book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen glanced at Annie with an inquiring expression. He
wondered whether she wished him to announce their engagement to her
aunt. The amazing suddenness of it all had begun to daunt him. He was
in considerable doubt as to what Miss Harriet Eustace, who was a most
conservative lady, who had always done exactly the things which a
lady under similar circumstances might be expected to do, who always
said the things to be expected, would say to this, which must, of
course, savour very much of the unexpected. Von Rosen was entirely
sure that Miss Harriet Eustace would be scarcely able to conceive of
a marriage engagement of her niece especially with a clergyman
without all the formal preliminaries of courtship, and he knew well
that preliminaries had hardly existed, in the usual sense of the
term. He felt absurdly shy, and he was very much relieved when
finally Miss Harriet and Annie took their leave and he had said
nothing about the engagement. Miss Harriet said a great deal about
his most interesting and improving collection. She was a woman of a
patronising turn of mind and she made Von Rosen feel like a little
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I especially appreciate the favour for the sake of my
niece,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is so desirable for the minds of
the young to be improved.&rdquo;  Von Rosen murmured a polite
acquiescence. She had spoken of his tall, lovely girl as if she were
in short skirts. Miss Harriet continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I consider what Mrs. Edes has done,&rdquo; she
said,&mdash;&ldquo;written a book which has made her famous, I
realise how exceedingly important it is for the minds of the young to
be improved. It is good for Annie to know Mrs. Edes so intimately, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time poor Annie was conscious of a distinct sense of
wrath. Here she herself had written that book and her mind, in order
to have written it, must be every whit as improved as Margaret Edes'
and her Aunt Harriet was belittling her before her lover. It was a
struggle to maintain silence, especially as her aunt went on talking
in a still more exasperating manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always considered Mrs. Wilbur Edes as a very unusual
woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but of course, this was unexpected. I
am so thankful that Annie has the great honour of her friendship. Of
course, Annie can never do what Mrs. Edes has done. She herself knows
that she lacks talent and also concentration. Annie, you know you
have never finished that daisy centre piece which you begun surely
six months ago. I am quite sure that Mrs. Edes would have finished it
in a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie did lose patience at that. &ldquo;Margaret just loathes
fancy work, Aunt Harriet,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;She would never
even have begun that centre piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much better never to begin a piece of work than never
to finish it,&rdquo; replied Aunt Harriet, &ldquo;and Mrs. Edes, my
dear, has been engaged in much more important work. If you had
written a book which had made you famous, no one could venture to
complain of your lack of industry with regard to the daisy centre
piece. But I am sure that Mrs. Edes, in order to have written that
book of which everybody is talking, must have displayed much industry
and concentration in all the minor matters of life. I think you must
be mistaken, my dear. I am quite sure that Mrs. Edes has not
neglected work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie made no rejoinder, but her aunt did not seem to notice
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so thankful, Mr. von Rosen,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;that my niece has the honour of being counted among the
friends of such a remarkable woman. May I inquire if Mrs. Edes has
ever seen your really extraordinary collection, Mr. von
Rosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she has not seen it,&rdquo; replied Von Rosen, and he
looked annoyed. Without in the least understanding the real trend of
the matter, he did not like to hear his sweetheart addressed after
such a fashion, even though he had no inkling of the real state of
affairs. To his mind, this exquisite little Annie, grimy daisy centre
piece and all, had accomplished much more in simply being herself,
than had Margaret Edes with her much blazoned book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust that she will yet see it,&rdquo; said Miss Harriet
Eustace. Harriet Eustace was tall, dull skinned and wide mouthed, and
she had a fashion, because she had been told from childhood that her
mouth was wide, of constantly puckering it as if she were eating
alum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be of course pleased to show Mrs. Edes my
collection at any time,&rdquo; said Von Rosen politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she will see it,&rdquo; said Harriet, puckering,
&ldquo;it is so improving, and if anything is improving to the
ordinary mind, what must it be to the mind of genius?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two took leave then, Annie walking behind her aunt. The
sidewalk which was encroached upon by grass was very narrow. Annie
did not speak at all. She heard her aunt talking incessantly without
realising the substance of what she said. Her own brain was
overwhelmed with bewilderment and happiness. Here was she, Annie
Eustace, engaged to be married and to the right man. The combination
was astounding. Annie had been conscious ever since she had first
seen him, that Karl von Rosen dwelt at the back of her thoughts, but
she was rather a well disciplined girl. She had not allowed herself
the luxury of any dreams concerning him and herself. She had not
considered the possibility of his caring for her, not because she
underestimated herself, but because she overestimated him. Now, she
knew he cared, he cared, and he wanted to marry her, to make her his
wife. After she had reached home, when they were seated at the tea
table, she did not think of telling anybody. She ate and felt as if
she were in a blissful crystal sphere of isolation. It did not occur
to her to reveal her secret until she went into her grandmother's
room rather late to bid her good night. Annie had been sitting by
herself on the front piazza and allowing herself a perfect feast in
future air-castles. She could see from where she sat, the lights from
the windows of the Edes' house, and she heard Wilbur's voice, and now
and then his laugh. Margaret's voice, she never heard at all. Annie
went into the chamber, the best in the house, and there lay her
grandmother, old Ann Maria Eustace, propped up in bed, reading a
novel which was not allowed in the Fairbridge library. She had bidden
Annie buy it for her, when she last went to New York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't ask a girl to buy such a book,&rdquo; the old
lady had said, &ldquo;but nobody will know you and I have read so
many notices about its wickedness, I want to see it for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now she looked up when Annie entered. &ldquo;It is not wicked at
all,&rdquo; she said in rather a disappointed tone. &ldquo;It is much
too dull. In order to make a book wicked, it must be, at least,
somewhat entertaining. The writer speaks of wicked things, but in
such a very moral fashion that it is all like a sermon. I don't like
the book at all. At the same time a girl like you had better not read
it and you had better see that Harriet and Susan don't get a glimpse
of it. They would be set into fits. It is a strange thing that both
my daughters should be such old maids to the bone and marrow. You can
read it though if you wish, Annie. I doubt if you understand the
wickedness anyway, and I don't want you to grow up straight-laced
like Harriet and Susan. It is really a misfortune. They lose a
lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Annie spoke. &ldquo;I shall not be an old maid, I
think,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! Who is going to marry you? I haven't seen a man in
this house except the doctor and the minister for the last twenty
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to marry the minister, Mr. von Rosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Annie's grandmother, and stared at her.
She was a queer looking old lady propped up on a flat pillow with her
wicked book. She had removed the front-piece which she wore by day
and her face showed large and rosy between the frills of her night
cap. Her china blue eyes were exceedingly keen and bright. Her mouth
as large as her daughter Harriet's, not puckered at all, but frankly
open in an alarming slit, in her amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When for goodness sake has the man courted you?&rdquo; she
burst forth at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know, if you don't. You haven't been meeting
him outside the house. No, you have not. You are a lady, if you have
been brought up by old maids, who tell lies about spades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know until this afternoon,&rdquo; said Annie.
&ldquo;Mr. von Rosen and I went out to see his rose-garden, while
Aunt Harriet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the old lady shook the bed with mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Harriet is scared to death
of roses and she went to sleep in the house and you got your chance.
Good for you. I am thankful the Eustace family won't quite sputter
out in old maids.&rdquo;  The old lady continued to chuckle. Annie
feared lest her aunts might hear. Beside the bed stood a table with
the collection of things which was Ann Maria Eustace's nightly
requirement. There were a good many things. First was a shaded
reading lamp, then a candle and a matchbox; there was a plate of thin
bread and butter carefully folded in a napkin. A glass of milk,
covered with a glass dish; two bottles of medicine; two spoons; a
saucer of sugared raspberries; exactly one square inch of American
cheese on a tiny plate; a pitcher of water, carefully covered; a
tumbler; a glass of port wine and a bottle of camphor. Old Ann Maria
Eustace took most of her sustenance at night. Night was really her
happy time. When that worn, soft old bulk of hers was ensconsed among
her soft pillows and feather bed and she had her eatables and
drinkables and literature at hand, she was in her happiest mood and
she was none the less happy from the knowledge that her daughters
considered that any well conducted old woman should have beside her
bed, merely a stand with a fair linen cloth, a glass of water, a
candle and the Good Book, and that if she could not go immediately to
sleep, she should lie quietly and say over texts and hymns to
herself. All Ann Maria's spice of life was got from a hidden
antagonism to her daughters and quietly flying in the face of their
prejudices, and she was the sort of old lady who could hardly have
lived at all without spice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Aunt Harriet will be hopping,&rdquo; said the perverse
old lady with another chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, grandmother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harriet has had an eye on him herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie gasped. &ldquo;Aunt Harriet must be at least twenty-five
years older,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;that doesn't amount to
anything. Harriet didn't put on her pearl breast-pin and crimp her
hair unless she had something in her mind. Susan has given up, but
Harriet hasn't given up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie still looked aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you going to get married?&rdquo; asked the old
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't settled that yet? Well, when you do, there's the
white satin embroidered with white roses that I was married in and my
old lace veil. I think he's a nice young man. All I have against him
is his calling. You will have to go to meeting whether you want to or
not and listen to the same man's sermons. But he is good looking and
they say he has money, and anyway, the Eustaces won't peter out in
old maids. There's one thing I am sorry about. Sunday is going to be
a pretty long day for me, after you are married, and I suppose
before. If you are going to marry that man, I suppose you will have
to begin going to meeting at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Annie spoke decidedly. &ldquo;I am always going to play
pinocle with you Sunday forenoons as long as you live,
grandmother,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you are married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you are married to a minister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady sat up straight and eyed Annie with her delighted
china blue gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. von Rosen is a lucky man,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Enough sight luckier than he knows. You are just like me,
Annie Eustace, and your grandfather set his eyes by me as long as he
lived. A good woman who has sense enough not to follow all the rules
and precepts and keep good, isn't found every day, and she can hold a
man and holding a man is about as tough a job as the Almighty ever
set a woman. I've got a pearl necklace and a ring in the bank.
Harriet has always wanted them but what is the use of a born old maid
decking herself out? I always knew Harriet and Susan would be old
maids. Why, they would never let their doll-babies be seen without
all their clothes on, seemed to think there was something indecent
about cotton cloth legs stuffed with sawdust. When you see a little
girl as silly as that you can always be sure she is cut out for an
old maid. I don't care when you get married&mdash;just as soon as you
want to&mdash;and you shall have a pretty wedding and you shall have
your wedding cake made after my old recipe. You are a good girl,
Annie. You look like me. You are enough sight better than you would
be if you were better, and you can make what you can out of that.
Now, you must go to bed. You haven't told Harriet and Susan yet, have
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell them myself in the morning,&rdquo; said the old
lady with a chuckle which made her ancient face a mask of mirth and
mischief. &ldquo;Now, you run along and go to bed. This book is dull,
but I want to see how wicked the writer tried to make it and the
heroine is just making an awful effort to run away with a married
man. She won't succeed, but I want to see how near she gets to it.
Good-night, Annie. You can have the book to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie went to her own room but she made no preparation for bed.
She had planned to work as she had worked lately until nearly
morning. She was hurrying to complete another book which she had
begun before Margaret Edes' announcement that she had written <i>The
Poor Lady</i>. The speedy completion of this book had been the
condition of secrecy with her publishers. However, Annie, before she
lit the lamp on her table could not resist the desire to sit for a
minute beside her window and gaze out upon the lovely night and revel
in her wonderful happiness. The night was lovely enough for anyone,
and for a girl in the rapture of her first love, it was as beautiful
as heaven. The broad village gleaming like silver in the moonlight
satisfied her as well as a street of gold and the tree shadows waved
softly over everything like wings of benediction. Sweet odours came
in her face. She could see the soft pallor of a clump of lilies in
the front yard. The shrilling of the night insects seemed like the
calls of prophets of happiness. The lights had gone out of the
windows of the Edes' house, but suddenly she heard a faint, very
faint, but very terrible cry and a white figure rushed out of the
Edes' gate. Annie did not wait a second. She was up, out of her room,
sliding down the stair banisters after the habit of her childhood and
after it.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter IX</h4>

<p>Margaret Edes, light and slender and supple as she was, and
moreover rendered swift with the terrible spur of hysteria, was no
match for Annie Eustace who had the build of a racing human, being
long-winded and limber. Annie caught up with her, just before they
reached Alice Mendon's house, and had her held by one arm. Margaret
gave a stifled shriek. Even in hysteria, she did not quite lose her
head. She had unusual self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she gasped. Annie saw that Margaret
carried a suit-case, which had probably somewhat hindered her
movements. &ldquo;Let me go, I shall miss the ten-thirty
train,&rdquo; Margaret said in her breathless voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anywhere,&mdash;away from it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two struggled together as far as Alice's gate, and to Annie's
great relief, a tall figure appeared, Alice herself. She opened the
gate and came on Margaret's other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to take the ten-thirty train,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going,&rdquo; said Alice Mendon; &ldquo;you
will return quietly to your own home like a sensible woman. You are
running away, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Margaret in her desperate voice.
&ldquo;You would run away if you were in my place, Alice
Mendon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never be in your place,&rdquo; said Alice,
&ldquo;but if I were, I should stay and face the situation.&rdquo;
She spoke with quite undisguised scorn and yet with pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must think of your husband and children and not
entirely of yourself,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Margaret, stammering as she spoke, &ldquo;I
tell Wilbur, I think it will kill him. If I tell the children, they
will never really have a mother again. They will never forget. But if
I do not tell, I shall not have myself. It is a horrible thing not to
have yourself, Alice Mendon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the only way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy for you to talk, Alice Mendon. You have never
been tempted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Alice, &ldquo;that is quite true. I have
never been tempted because&mdash;I cannot be tempted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no credit to you. You were made so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true also. I was made so. It is no credit to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret tried to wrench her arm free from Annie's grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go, Annie Eustace,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hate
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if you do,&rdquo; replied Annie. &ldquo;I
don't love you any more myself. I don't hate you, but I certainly
don't love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stole your laurels,&rdquo; said Margaret, and she seemed
to snap out the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have had the laurels,&rdquo; said Annie,
&ldquo;without stealing, if I could have given them to you. It is not
the laurels that matter. It is you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will kill myself if it ever is known,&rdquo; said
Margaret in a low horrified whisper. She cowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will never be known unless you yourself tell it,&rdquo;
said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I have thought
it all over. I cannot tell and yet, how can I live and not
tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Alice Mendon, &ldquo;that always
when people do wrong, they have to endure punishment. I suppose that
is your punishment, Margaret. You have always loved yourself and now
you will have to despise yourself. I don't see any way out of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the only woman who does such things,&rdquo; said
Margaret, and there was defiance in her tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt, you have company,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;That
does not make it easier for you.&rdquo;  Alice, large and fair in her
white draperies, towered over Margaret Edes like an embodied
conscience. She was almost unendurable, like the ideal of which the
other woman had fallen short. Her mere presence was maddening.
Margaret actually grimaced at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy for you to preach,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;very
easy, Alice Mendon. You have not a nerve in your whole body. You have
not an ungratified ambition. You neither love nor hate yourself, or
other people. You want nothing on earth enough to make the lack of it
disturb you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How well you read me,&rdquo; said Alice and she smiled a
large calm smile as a statue might smile, could she relax her
beautiful marble mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as for Annie Eustace,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;she
has what I stole, and she knows it, and that is enough for her. Oh,
both of you look down upon me and I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look down upon you no more than I have always
done,&rdquo; said Alice; but Annie was silent because she could not
say that truly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you have always looked down upon me, Alice
Mendon,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and you never had
reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the reason,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;that your own
deeds have proved true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not know that I would do such a thing. I did not
know it myself. Why, I never knew that Annie Eustace could write a
book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that a self-lover could do anything and everything
to further her own ends,&rdquo; said Alice in her inexorable voice,
which yet contained an undertone of pity.</p>

<p>She pitied Margaret far more than Annie could pity her for she had
not loved her so much. She felt the little arm tremble in her clasp
and her hand tightened upon it as a mother's might have done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, we have had enough of this,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;quite enough. Margaret, you must positively go home at once. I
will take your suit-case, and return it to you to-morrow. I shall be
out driving. You can get in without being seen, can't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you both, I am going,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;I
cannot face what is before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All creation has to face what is before. Running makes no
difference,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;You will meet it at the end of
every mile. Margaret Edes, go home. Take care of your husband, and
your children and keep your secret and let it tear you for your own
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are to nominate Wilbur for Senator,&rdquo; said
Margaret. &ldquo;If they knew, if he knew, Wilbur would not run. He
has always had ambition. I should kill it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not kill it,&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;Here, give
me that suit-case, I will set it inside the gate here. Now Annie and
I will walk with you and you must steal in and not wake anybody and
go to bed and to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sleep,&rdquo; repeated Margaret bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then not to sleep, but you must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three passed down the moon-silvered road. When they had
reached Margaret's door, Alice suddenly put an arm around her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in as softly as you can, and to bed,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you do that, Alice?&rdquo; asked Annie in a small
voice when the door had closed behind Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I am beginning to love her,&rdquo; whispered Alice.
&ldquo;Now you know what we must do, Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must both watch until dawn, until after that train to
New York which stops here at three-thirty. You must stand here and I
will go to the other door. Thank God, there are only two doors, and I
don't think she will try the windows because she won't suspect our
being here. But I don't trust her, poor thing. She is desperate. You
stay here, Annie. Sit down close to the door and&mdash;you won't be
afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, there is nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; said
Alice. &ldquo;Now I will go to the other door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie sat there until the moon sank. She did not feel in the least
sleepy. She sat there and counted up her joys of life and almost
forgot poor Margaret who had trampled hers in the dust raised by her
own feet of self-seeking. Then came the whistle and roar of a train
and Alice stole around the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is safe enough for us to go now,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;That was the last train. Do you think you can get in your
house without waking anybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no danger unless I wake grandmother. She wakes
very early of herself and she may not be asleep and her hearing is
very quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must hurry. It is lucky that my room is away from
the others or I should not be sure of getting there unsuspected.
Hurry, Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two sped swiftly and noiselessly down the street, which was
now very dark. The village houses seemed rather awful with their dark
windows like sightless eyes. When they reached Annie's house Alice
gave her a swift kiss. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, little Annie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to be married, to Mr. Von Rosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice started ever so slightly. &ldquo;You are a lucky
girl,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and he is a lucky man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alice flickered out of sight down the street like a white moonbeam
and Annie stole into the house. She dared not lock the door behind
her lest she arouse somebody. She tip-toed upstairs, but as she was
passing her grandmother's door, it was opened, and the old woman
stood there, her face lit by her flaring candle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just march right in here,&rdquo; said she so loud that
Annie shuddered for fear she would arouse the whole house. She
followed her grandmother into her room and the old woman turned and
looked at her, and her face was white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Miss?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is
after three o'clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to go, grandmother, and there was no harm, but I
can't tell you. Indeed, I can't,&rdquo; replied Annie, trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can't you? I'd like to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't, indeed, I can't, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, I'd like to know. Pretty doings, I call
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't tell you why not, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman eyed the girl. &ldquo;Out with a man&mdash;I don't
care if you are engaged to him&mdash;till this time!&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>Annie started and crimsoned. &ldquo;Oh, grandmother!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care if he is a minister. I am going to see him
to-morrow, no, to-day, right after breakfast and give him a piece of
my mind. I don't care what he thinks of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, there wasn't any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you always have since that time when you were
a little girl and I spanked you for lying,&rdquo; said the old woman.
&ldquo;I rather think you do tell the truth, but sometimes when a
girl gets a man into her head, she goes round like a top. You haven't
been alone, you needn't tell me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven't been alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, he wasn't with you? There wasn't any man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there was not any man, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better get into your own room as fast as you
can and move still or you will wake up Harriet and Susan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Annie went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thankful I am not curious,&rdquo; said the old woman
clambering back into bed. She lit her lamp and took up her novel
again.</p>

<p>The next morning old Ann Maria Eustace announced her
granddaughter's engagement at the breakfast table. She waited until
the meal was in full swing, then she raised her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; she said, looking first at Harriet,
then at Susan, &ldquo;I have some good news for you. Our little Annie
here is too modest, so I have to tell you for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet Eustace laughed unsuspiciously. &ldquo;Don't tell us that
Annie has been writing a great anonymous novel like Margaret
Edes,&rdquo; she said, and Susan laughed also. &ldquo;Whatever news
it may be, it is not that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nobody could
suspect Annie of writing a book. I myself was not so much surprised
at Margaret Edes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Annie's consternation, her grandmother turned upon her a long,
slow, reading look. She flushed under it and swallowed a spoonful of
cereal hastily. Then her grandmother chuckled under her breath and
her china blue eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Annie has done something a deal better than to write a
book,&rdquo; said she, looking away from the girl, and fixing
unsparing eyes upon her daughters. &ldquo;She has found a nice man to
marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet and Susan dropped their spoons and stared at their
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, what are you talking about?&rdquo; said Harriet
sharply. &ldquo;She has had no attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; drawled the old lady in a way she
affected when she wished to be exasperating, &ldquo;sometimes, a
little attention is so strong that it counts and sometimes attention
is attention when nobody thinks it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Harriet in rather a hard voice.
Susan regarded Annie with a bewildered, yet kindly smile. Poor Susan
had never regarded the honey pots of life as intended for herself,
and thus could feel a kindly interest in their acquisition by
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My granddaughter is engaged to be married to Mr. von
Rosen,&rdquo; said the old lady. Then she stirred her coffee
assiduously.</p>

<p>Susan rose and kissed Annie. &ldquo;I hope you will be happy, very
happy,&rdquo; she said in an awed voice. Harriet rose, to follow her
sister's example but she looked viciously at her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a good ten years older than Annie,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good twenty-five younger than you,&rdquo; said the
old lady, and sipped her coffee delicately. &ldquo;He is just the
right age for Annie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet kissed Annie, but her lips were cold and Annie wondered.
It never occurred to her then, nor later, to imagine that her Aunt
Harriet might have had her own dreams which had never entirely ended
in rainbow mists. She did not know how hardly dreams die. They are
sometimes not entirely stamped out during a long lifetime.</p>

<p>That evening Von Rosen came to call on Annie and she received him
alone in the best parlour. She felt embarrassed and shy, but very
happy. Her lover brought her an engagement ring, a great pearl, which
had been his mother's and put it on her finger, and Annie eyed her
finger with a big round gaze like a bird's. Von Rosen laughed at the
girl holding up her hand and staring at the beringed finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you like it, dear?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the most beautiful ring I ever saw,&rdquo; said
Annie, &ldquo;but I keep thinking it may not be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truest things in the world are the things which do not
seem so,&rdquo; he said, and caught up the slender hand and kissed
the ring and the finger.</p>

<p>Margaret on the verandah had seen Von Rosen enter the Eustace
house and had guessed dully at the reason. She had always thought
that Von Rosen would eventually marry Alice Mendon and she wondered a
little, but not much. Her own affairs were entirely sufficient to
occupy her mind. Her position had become more impossible to alter and
more ghastly. That night Wilbur had brought home a present to
celebrate her success. It was something which she had long wanted and
which she knew he could ill afford:&mdash;a circlet of topazes for
her hair. She kissed him and put it on to please him, but it was to
her as if she were crowned because of her infamy and she longed to
snatch the thing off and trample it. And yet always she was well
aware that it was not remorse which she felt, but a miserable
humiliation that she, Margaret Edes, should have cause for remorse.
The whole day had been hideous. The letters and calls of
congratulation had been incessant. There were brief notices in a few
papers which had been marked and sent to her and Wilbur had brought
them home also. Her post-office box had been crammed. There were
requests for her autograph. There were requests for aid from
charitable institutions. There were requests for advice and
assistance from young authors. She had two packages of manuscripts
sent her for inspection concerning their merits. One was a short
story, and came through the mail; one was a book and came by express.
She had requests for work from editors and publishers. Wilbur had
brought a letter of congratulation from his partner. It was
absolutely impossible for her to draw back except for that ignoble
reason: the reinstatement of herself in her own esteem. She could not
possibly receive all this undeserved adulation and retain her self
esteem. It was all more than she had counted upon. She had opened
Pandora's box with a vengeance and the stinging things swarmed over
her. Wilbur sat on the verandah with her and scarcely took his eyes
of adoring wonder from her face. She had sent the little girls to bed
early. They had told all their playmates and talked incessantly with
childish bragging. They seemed to mock her as with peacock eyes,
symbolic of her own vanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent the poor little things to bed very early,&rdquo;
Wilbur said. &ldquo;They did so enjoy talking over their mother's
triumph. It is the greatest day of their lives, you know,
Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired of it,&rdquo; Margaret said sharply, but
Wilbur's look of worship deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so modest, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said and Margaret
writhed. Poor Wilbur had been reading <i>The Poor Lady</i> instead of
his beloved newspapers and now and then he quoted a passage which he
remembered, with astonishing accuracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, darling, you are a marvel,&rdquo; he would remark
after every quotation. &ldquo;Now, how in the world did you ever
manage to think that up? I suppose just this minute, as you sit there
looking so sweet in your white dress, just such things are floating
through your brain, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they are not,&rdquo; replied Margaret. Oh, if she had
only understood the horrible depth of a lie!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose Von Rosen is making up to little Annie?&rdquo; said
Wilbur presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she is a nice little thing, sweet tempered, and
pretty, although of course her mental calibre is limited. She may
make a good wife, though. A man doesn't expect his wife always to set
the river on fire as you have done, sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Wilbur fished from his pockets a lot of samples.
&ldquo;Thought I must order a new suit, to live up to my wife,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;See which you prefer, Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think your own political outlook would make the
new suit necessary,&rdquo; said Margaret tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. Get more votes if you look a bit shabby
from the sort who I expect may get me the office,&rdquo; laughed
Wilbur. &ldquo;This new suit is simply to enable me to look worthy,
as far as my clothes are concerned, of my famous wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have already clothes enough,&rdquo; said
Margaret coldly.</p>

<p>Wilbur looked hurt. &ldquo;Doesn't make much difference how the
old man looks, does it, dear?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the samples,&rdquo; Margaret returned with an
effort. There were depths beyond depths; there were bottomless
quicksands in a lie. How could she have known?</p>

<p>That night Wilbur looked into his wife's bedroom at midnight.
&ldquo;Awake?&rdquo; he asked in his monosyllabic fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, old girl, Von Rosen has just this minute gone. Guess
it's a match fast enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought it would be Alice,&rdquo; returned
Margaret wearily. Love affairs did seem so trivial to her at this
juncture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice Mendon has never cared a snap about getting married
any way,&rdquo; returned Wilbur. &ldquo;Some women are built that
way. She is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret did not inquire how he knew. If Wilbur had told her that
he had himself asked Alice in marriage, it would have been as if she
had not heard. All such things seemed very unimportant to her in the
awful depths of her lie. She said good-night in answer to Wilbur's
and again fell to thinking. There was no way out, absolutely no way.
She must live and die with this secret self-knowledge which abased
her, gnawing at the heart. Wilbur had told her that he believed that
her authorship of <i>The Poor Lady</i> might be the turning point of
his election. She was tongue-tied in a horrible spiritual sense. She
was disfigured for the rest of her life and she could never once turn
away her eyes from her disfigurement.</p>

<p>The light from Annie Eustace's window shone in her room for two
hours after that. She wondered what she was doing and guessed Annie
was writing a new novel to take the place of the one of which she had
robbed her. An acute desire which was like a pain to be herself the
injured instead of the injurer possessed her. Oh, what would it mean
to be Annie sitting there, without leisure to brood over her new
happiness, working, working, into the morning hours and have nothing
to look upon except moral and physical beauty in her mental
looking-glass. She envied the poor girl, who was really working
beyond her strength, as she had never envied any human being. The
envy stung her, and she could not sleep. The next morning she looked
ill and then she had to endure Wilbur's solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl, you overworked writing your splendid
book,&rdquo; he said. Then he suggested that she spend a month at an
expensive seashore resort and another horror was upon Margaret.
Wilbur, she well knew, could not afford to send her to such a place,
but was innocently, albeit rather shamefacedly, assuming that she
could defray her own expenses from the revenue of her book. He would
never call her to account as to what she had done with the wealth
which he supposed her to be reaping. She was well aware of that, but
he would naturally wonder within himself. Any man would. She said
that she was quite well, that she hated a big hotel, and much
preferred home during the hot season, but she heard the roar of these
new breakers. How could she have dreamed of the lifelong disturbance
which a lie could cause?</p>

<p>Night after night she saw the light in Annie's windows and she
knew what she was doing. She knew why she was not to be married until
next winter. That book had to be written first. Poor Annie could not
enjoy her romance to the full because of over-work. The girl lost
flesh and Margaret knew why. Preparing one's trousseau, living in a
love affair, and writing a book, are rather strenuous, when
undertaken at the same time.</p>

<p>It was February when Annie and Von Rosen were married and the
wedding was very quiet. Annie had over-worked, but her book was
published, and was out-selling <i>The Poor Lady</i>. It also was
published anonymously, but Margaret knew, she knew even from the
reviews. Then she bought the book and read it and was convinced. The
book was really an important work. The writer had gone far beyond her
first flight, but there was something unmistakable about the style to
such a jealous reader as Margaret. Annie had her success after all.
She wore her laurels, although unseen of men, with her orange
blossoms. Margaret saw in every paper, in great headlines, the notice
of the great seller. The best novel for a twelve-month&mdash;<i>The
Firm Hand</i>. Wilbur talked much about it. He had his election. He
was a Senator, and was quietly proud of it, but nothing mattered to
him as much as Margaret's book. That meant more than his own
success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read that novel they are talking so much about and
it cannot compare with yours,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;The
publishers ought to push yours a little more. Do you think I ought to
look in on them and have a little heart-to-heart talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret's face was ghastly. &ldquo;Don't do anything of the
sort,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won't if you don't want me to,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly don't want you to.&rdquo;  Then Margaret
never had a day of peace. She feared lest Wilbur, who seemed nightly
more incensed at the flaming notices of <i>The Firm Hand</i> might,
in spite of her remonstrances, go to see the publishers, and would
they keep the secret if he did?</p>

<p>Margaret continued to live as she had done before. That was part
of the horror. She dared not resign from the Zenith Club. However,
she came in time to get a sort of comfort from it. Meeting all those
members, presiding over the meetings, became a sort of secret
flagellation, which served as a counter irritation, for her tormented
soul. All those women thought well of her. They admired her. The
acute torture which she derived from her knowledge of herself, as
compared with their opinion of her, seemed at times to go a little
way toward squaring her account with her better self. And the club
also seemed to rouse within her a keener vitality of her better self.
Especially when the New Year came and Mrs. Slade was elected
president in her stead. Once, Margaret would have been incapable of
accepting that situation so gracefully. She gave a reception to Mrs.
Slade in honour of her election, and that night had a little return
of her lost peace. Then during one of the meetings, a really good
paper was read, which set her thinking. That evening she played
dominoes with Maida and Adelaide, and always after that a game
followed dinner. The mother became intimate with her children. She
really loved them because of her loss of love for herself, and
because the heart must hold love. She loved her husband too, but he
realised no difference because he had loved her. That coldness had
had no headway against such doting worship. But the children
realised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma is so much better since she wrote that book that I
shall be glad when you are old enough to write a book too,&rdquo;
Adelaide said once to Maida.</p>

<p>But always Margaret suffered horribly, although she gave no sign.
She took care of her beauty. She was more particular than ever about
her dress. She entertained, she accepted every invitation, and they
multiplied since Wilbur's flight in politics and her own reputed
authorship. She was Spartan in her courage, but she suffered, because
she saw herself as she was and she had so loved herself. It was not
until Annie Eustace was married that she obtained the slightest
relief. Then she ascertained that the friend whom she had robbed of
her laurels had obtained a newer and greener crown of them. She went
to the wedding and saw on a table, Annie's new book. She glanced at
it and she knew and she wondered if Von Rosen knew. He did not.</p>

<p>Annie waited until after their return from their short wedding
journey when they were settled in their home. Then one evening,
seated with her husband before the fire in the study, with the yellow
cat in her lap, and the bull terrier on the rug, his white skin rosy
in the firelight, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Karl, I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen looked lovingly at her. &ldquo;Well, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, only you must not tell, for the publishers
insist upon its being anonymous, I&mdash;wrote <i>The Firm
Hand</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Von Rosen made a startled exclamation and looked at Annie and she
could not understand the look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you displeased?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Don't you
like me to write? I will never neglect you or our home because of it.
Indeed I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Displeased,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. He got up and
deliberately knelt before her. &ldquo;I am proud that you are my
wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;prouder than I am of anything else in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please get up, dear,&rdquo; said Annie, &ldquo;but I am so
glad, although it is really I who am proud, because I have you for my
husband. I feel all covered over with peacock's eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine a human soul less like a peacock,&rdquo;
said Von Rosen. He put his arms around her as he knelt, and kissed
her, and the yellow cat gave an indignant little snarl and jumped
down. He was jealous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Annie, laughing. &ldquo;I thought the
time had come to tell you and I hoped you would be pleased. It is
lovely, isn't it? You know it is selling wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lovely,&rdquo; said Von Rosen. &ldquo;It would have
been lovely anyway, but your success is a mighty sweet morsel for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go back to your chair and smoke and I will
read to you,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as if you had not written a successful novel,&rdquo;
said Von Rosen. But he obeyed, the more readily because he knew, and
pride and reverence for his wife fairly dazed him. Von Rosen had been
more acute than the critics and Annie had written at high pressure,
and one can go over a book a thousand times and be blind to things
which should be seen. She had repeated one little sentence which she
had written in <i>The Poor Lady</i>. Von Rosen knew, but he never
told her that he knew. He bowed before her great, generous silence as
he would have bowed before a shrine, but he knew that she had written
<i>The Poor Lady</i>, and had allowed Margaret Edes to claim
unquestioned the honour of her work.</p>

<p>As they sat there, Annie's Aunt Susan came in and sat with them.
She talked a good deal about the wedding presents. Wedding presents
were very wonderful to her. They were still spread out, most of them
on tables in the parlour because all Fairbridge was interested in
viewing them. After a while Susan went into the parlour and gloated
over the presents. When she came back, she wore a slightly disgusted
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have beautiful presents,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I
have been looking all around and the presents are not all on those
tables, are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Annie.</p>

<p>Von Rosen laughed. He knew what was coming, or thought that he
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Aunt Susan, &ldquo;that you have
forty-two copies of Margaret Edes' book, <i>The Poor Lady</i>, and I
have always thought it was a very silly book, and you can't exchange
them for every single one is autographed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite true. Poor Margaret Edes had autographed the
forty-two. She had not even dreamed of the incalculable depths of a
lie.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
